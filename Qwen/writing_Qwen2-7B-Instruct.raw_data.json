You've just lived through the second death of the universe and show no sign of stopping. Death is baffled. \"How?\" he asked, his voice still as cold as the day I met him. \"After eons and eons of heartbreak and loss, war and hatred, how are you still in love with life?\" \"It's simple, really.\" I replied, \"You of all people should know of the circle.\" \"The circle!

Their mother had died last week in a territory battle. We don't get those much in the reserve because of the large space and abundant resources, but it still happens. This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest. I knew her hatchlings would be too young to fend for themselves. I found them easily. She hadn't moved them since I stumbled upon them the first time, likely too weak from the cancer.

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle. Breaking the seal on the letter, I unrolled it, reading the letter. *Dear Hanna, If you are reading this, then I have failed. We are cursed, and soon it will pass to you.

The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake.

You are free to leave, and my only order is this: I forbid you to shame any soldier who chooses to walk away.

The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze",

Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument. No matter how well-formed her thoughts were, they came out as quips. She wasn't a genius, but she would never stoop to one-liners if she had a choice. What you're doing here",

Fewer gestures, more constraint when she was supposed to be care free, joyous and brilliant. Great",
        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

        "[ CW ] Describe the room you're sitting in, maybe r/doodle will sketch it. This would be a test of how someone processes your words and then uses their imagination to draw it. It might also help them understand what you mean when you describe things.\nThe room I'm currently sitting in is quite cozy and intimate. It's a small bedroom adorned with a soft, plush carpet that feels warm underfoot. The walls are painted in a soothing shade of light blue, which complements the natural wooden furniture. There's a large window on one side of the room, its curtains made of a sheer, white material that filters the sunlight beautifully, casting a gentle glow over the space.\n\nThe centerpiece of the room is a king-sized bed, dressed in crisp, white linens with subtle floral patterns. It's positioned against the wall opposite the window, allowing for ample light during the day. The headboard is a dark wood, providing a contrast to the lighter tones of the room. A",
        "Living in the worst possible timeline / If there is a parallel universe for every possible outcome, there must be one with the worst possible outcomes. Mortimer J. Adler (1902-2001) was an American philosopher and educator who wrote many books on philosophy, education, and politics. He was a professor at several universities, including the University of Chicago, where he taught ethics and political philosophy.\nIn his book \"How to Read a Book\" (1940), Adler argued that reading a book well required more than just understanding its content; it also required being able to analyze and evaluate it critically. In this way, he emphasized the importance of critical thinking skills in education.\nAdler believed that education should not only impart knowledge but also develop critical thinking skills, enabling individuals to think for themselves and make informed decisions. He argued that this was essential for personal growth and societal progress.\nAdler's ideas have had a lasting impact on the field of education, and his",
        "The day Death died. A young girl sat on a park bench on a brightly colored autumn day. Though her slightly hunched posture subtly indicated she was in pain, the colors of her clothing and the flowers in her hair indicated a joyful spirit. She was about to turn ten years old. Her name was Lily.\nLily was a very special girl. She was an orphan who lived with her aunt and uncle, but they didn\u2019t care for her much. She was a sweet girl, but her family was not kind to her. She often went without food and was left alone for long periods of time. She was also very sickly. Lily was not healthy, but she had a strong will and a strong spirit that kept her going.\nOne day, Lily was sitting on the park bench when she heard a voice. It was a man\u2019s voice. \u201cHello, little one,\u201d the voice said.\nLily looked around, but there was no one there. She looked up at the sky",
        "Don't leave me, you're my best friend. A little girl sat alone on her bed with her legs tucked tightly to her chest, her arms wrapped around them as she stared at the ground in front of her. The room was dark except for a small light that shone from the lamp on her nightstand. She didn't know how long she had been sitting there, but it felt like hours. Her eyes were red and puffy from crying, and her heart felt heavy with sadness.\n\nShe missed her best friend, who had just moved away to live with her family in another state. They had been inseparable since they were toddlers, playing together every day and sharing secrets and dreams. Now, all she had left was memories and a small photo album filled with pictures of their adventures.\n\nThe little girl's thoughts were interrupted by a soft knock on the door. \"Come in,\" she whispered, not wanting to be alone in her sorrow.\n\nHer mother",
        "Explain a piece of modern technology to a person from around 100-500 CE. \"Look, are you even trying to comprehend the complexity of this device? It is a marvel of our age, the telephone! This little contraption allows two people, who may be miles apart, to converse with each other as if they were in the same room. \n\nImagine this: If you were in Rome and I was in Constantinople, we could speak directly to one another through this device. The sound of my voice would travel through the wire, reach the telephone at your end, and you would hear it as clearly as if I was whispering in your ear. \n\nAnd not just words, but also sounds! You can hear the rustle of clothing, the clatter of dishes, or the distant barking of a dog. It's like having a direct line into someone else's world. It's a bridge across distances, a magical connection that allows us to share",
        "A little girl helps her neighbor overcome his vow of silence he made after his wife passed away 40 years ago. I've lived next door to a man named Mr. Smith for over 25 years. I knew that his wife had passed away when she was in her late 60s, but I never knew how it affected him until about five years ago. I would hear him crying at night, but I never knew what the cause was. He never talked about it with me. I would ask him if he was okay, and he would just say yes. But one day, I heard him crying again, and I couldn't take it anymore. I knocked on his door and asked him if everything was okay. He told me that he was missing his wife and that he couldn't talk about it because he had made a vow to himself 40 years ago that he wouldn't speak again after she passed",
        "A 101-year old bottle washed up on a beach with a letter inside. It's for you. I park my car beside the bridge that leads to the beach, the one that connects the town of Tuckerton to Island Beach State Park. It's a beautiful summer day in New Jersey and I'm here because someone left a note in a bottle on the beach for me.\nIt's an old bottle, about the size of a water bottle, but much heavier. I take it out of the bag and look at it. It's not a glass bottle, but made of some kind of thick plastic. I turn it over and read the writing on the bottom: \"Found in Tuckerton NJ on 8/27/2019.\" It's dated!\nI open the bottle carefully and pull out the letter. It's yellowed and worn from the sun, but the handwriting is still clear. I unfold it and begin to read:\n\"Dear [Name",
        "A man is banished to the wilderness for 20 years. Write his diary entries for his first and last days of exile. Day 1 - Exile Begins:\n\nWoke up in a cold sweat, heart pounding like a drum against my ribcage. The world as I knew it was gone. No more bustling streets, no laughter, no familiar faces. Just this vast, silent wilderness that stretches out before me, mocking my fear with its endless expanse.\n\nI'm alone. Completely and utterly alone. My family, friends, everything that defined me, is now but a memory. A faint whisper on the wind. My mind races with questions: How long can I survive? Will I ever find my way back home? Or am I destined to wander these barren lands forever?\n\nThe sun rises, casting an eerie orange glow over the trees. It's a new day, but it feels like the end of the world. I stumble through the forest, trying to find my footing",
        "The running faucet The faucet had a third knob. She tried the knob on the left, and hot water came out of the faucet. Just as she was about to use it, her sister came in and turned the knob on the right, and cold water came out. Her brother then turned the knob in the middle, and ice cubes came out. What kind of faucet did she have?\nI'm thinking it is a faucet that can dispense hot water, cold water, and ice cubes but I'm not sure if that's possible.\n You are correct that there is no faucet that can do this. It would be a combination of three separate faucets with different functions. The knobs could be used to select which one is being used, but not all three at once. So you would have something like:\n\n*\n\n*Hot water faucet (with a knob for controlling temperature)\n\n*Cold water faucet (with a knob for controlling temperature)\n\n*Ice maker (with a button or lever to dispense ice"
