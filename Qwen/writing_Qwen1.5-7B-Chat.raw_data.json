You've just lived through the second death of the universe and show no sign of stopping. Death is baffled. \"How?\" he asked, his voice still as cold as the day I met him. \"After eons and eons of heartbreak and loss, war and hatred, how are you still in love with life?\" \"It's simple, really.\" I replied, \"You of all people should know of the circle.\" \"The circle! Ha!\" Death snorted. \"Yes, the circle.

Their mother had died last week in a territory battle. We don't get those much in the reserve because of the large space and abundant resources, but it still happens. This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest. I knew her hatchlings would be too young to fend for themselves. I found them easily. She hadn't moved them since I stumbled upon them the first time, likely too weak from the cancer.

Should we all just forget about this and go home? Maybe...... Should we heed the AI's warning? We all looked at each other, each person in the lab more afraid then the next to say a word.

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle. Breaking the seal on the letter, I unrolled it, reading the letter. *Dear Hanna, If you are reading this, then I have failed. We are cursed, and soon it will pass to you.

The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake.

The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze",

        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

The child, trembling with fear, couldn't believe what they were seeing - the monster was much larger than it had imagined, with razor-sharp claws and a scaly body that seemed to shift in the dim light.\n\nThe air grew thick with an eerie silence, broken only by the child's rapid heartbeat. Their mind raced, trying to make sense of this terrifying situation. They had heard stories about monsters in the closet, but never did they think they would encounter one so real.\n\nWith a sudden burst of courage, the child gathered all their strength and cried out, hoping their parents would hear.

        "Your ascent into sanity The thrill of defeating the pure incarnation of evil vibrated through every inch of my body. This thing was finally dead after four years of relentless pursuit, and I had been the one to bring it down. The weight of my accomplishment was almost too much to bear.\n\nAs I stood in the dimly lit laboratory, the air was thick with the scent of victory and decay. The once-mighty artifact, a cursed artifact that had claimed countless lives, lay lifeless at my feet. Its power, once so formidable, now reduced to mere dust.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to steady my shaking hands. My eyes, bloodshot from lack of sleep and the intensity of the fight, scanned the room for any signs of life. But there was none.

You don't. 18yo\n\nAs an AI language model, I don't have a physical existence and therefore cannot receive gifts or notes from my own children or anyone else. However, if you are a parent who has not received a gift or note from your 18-year-old child through time travel, it's understandable to feel curious or concerned about the situation.\n\nIt's possible that your child may have chosen not to send a gift or message, or perhaps there is some logistical issue with the time travel aspect that you are not aware of. Alternatively, they may have a personal reason for not doing so that they prefer not to share.\n\nIf you're feeling left out or unsure about the situation, you could consider having a conversation with your child to ask about their intentions. It's also worth keeping in mind that the importance of such",

Mortimer\u9633\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe concept of the multiverse, where each possible outcome of an event is its own separate reality, is a popular topic in science fiction and philosophy. This idea has been explored by many scientists and philosophers, including physicist Stephen Hawking and philosopher David Deutsch. However, the existence of parallel universes and their implications are still a matter of debate and speculation.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss the concept of a \"worst possible timeline\" or parallel universe, which is often discussed in popular culture. We will explore the philosophical and scientific aspects of this idea, as well as its limitations and challenges.\n\n### What is a worst possible timeline?\n\nA worst possible timeline, also known as a \"negative timeline\" or \"anti-universe,\" refers to a hypothetical scenario in which every possible outcome of a given event or set of events",

Though her slightly hunched posture subtly indicated she was anything but carefree, her eyes sparkled with an unspoken joy as she watched the leaves falling from the trees. \n\nDeath walked by, his long black cloak billowing in the wind. He carried a small bouquet of white lilies, their sweet fragrance mingling with the crisp October air.

He's always been a bit of a mystery to me. He never speaks, and he never leaves his house. As a child, I would play hide-and-seek behind his fence and peek through his windows, but he never noticed. When I grew up and moved out, I thought maybe he was just a shy person who preferred to keep to himself. But as I got older, I started to worry about him. His house is old, and sometimes it looks like it's not being taken care of. I've seen mice running around inside, and the lawn hasn't been mowed in months.
