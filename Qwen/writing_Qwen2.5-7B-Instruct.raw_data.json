You've just lived through the second death of the universe and show no sign of stopping. Death is baffled. \"How?\" he asked, his voice still as cold as the day I met him. \"After eons and eons of heartbreak and loss, war and hatred, how are you still in love with life?\" \"It's simple, really.\" I replied, \"You of all people should know of the circle.\" \"The circle!

This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest. I knew her hatchlings would be too young to fend for themselves. I found them easily. She hadn't moved them since I stumbled upon them the first time, likely too weak from the cancer.

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle.

The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake.

The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze",

I felt I had nowhere to go, so when someone offered the chance to \"change the world\" and more importantly, to finally grow close to people, I snatched it. I didn't realize what that would turn me into. I now serve as part of a unit of highly trained specialist soldiers. We afford the government a high degree of deniability, because as far as they are concerned, we don't exist. I've done things, horrible things, as a result of working with this group of men. Killed countless people, some of them horrible, but many just trying to get by. I've destroyed homes, butchered",
        "[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the ultimate theme of The Dark Tower series. Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument. No matter how well-formed her thoughts were, they came out as quips. She wasn't a genius, but she",

        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

Above the desk, there's a shelf filled with various books and a framed photo of what looks like a beautiful landscape. To my right, there\u2019s a bookshelf lined with more books and a few decorative items. The floor is covered with a soft rug, and there\u2019s a small plant on a side table near the door. The overall atmosphere is warm and inviting, perfect for working or relaxing. \n\n[r/doodle]",

        "The day Death died. A young girl sat on a park bench on a brightly colored autumn day. Though her slightly hunched posture subtly indicated she was in pain, she smiled and waved at a man who stopped to admire her bright red hair. She reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, shiny object that caught the sun. It was a locket, and inside were pictures of a woman with dark hair and a man with sandy hair. The man smiled at her, and she smiled back. They had been her parents. Her father had died just over a year ago, and her mother had passed away only last month. She knew it was time. She stood up, took one last look at the place where her parents' ashes were scattered, and walked away. No one saw her as she slipped into the woods, or the way she walked until she could no longer walk. She lay down in the soft grass and closed her eyes, smiling at the stars above her. She was",
        "Don't leave me, you're my best friend. A little girl sat alone on her bed with her legs tucked tightly to her chest, her arms wrapped around her knees and her head buried in her arms. She was sobbing uncontrollably. Her best friend, a stuffed animal in the shape of a dog, lay at her feet. The little girl's mother walked into the room and saw her daughter crying. She knelt down beside her and asked what was wrong. The little girl looked up at her mother through her tears and said, \"I thought you were leaving.\" The mother hugged her daughter and said, \"I'm not going anywhere. You're my little girl and I'll always be here for you.\" The little girl snuggled into her mother's embrace and cried herself to sleep. The stuffed animal, the little girl's best friend, lay at their feet, watching over them.\n\nWhat are some possible reasons why the little girl might have thought her mother was leaving?",

Tell me of this wondrous device you speak of, the internet.**\n\n**Traveler: Indeed, it is a marvel of our time.

Do they fly like birds or ride upon the wind?**\n\n**Traveler: No,",
        "A little girl helps her neighbor overcome his vow of silence he made after his wife passed away 40 years ago. I've lived next door to a man named Bill for over twenty years. He's always been a very quiet and private person, but in the last few years he has become even more withdrawn. Bill is in his mid-70s and his wife died four decades ago. He's made a vow never to speak again because he feels that his words can't do justice to the love he felt for her. I'm a young mother with two small children. My son, who was about five at the time, would often climb through the fence between our yards and play with Bill. Bill would sit on his front porch swing and watch my son play. One day when my son was playing with Bill, I heard Bill say, \"That's a pretty shirt.\" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I ran",
        "A 101-year old bottle washed up on a beach with a letter inside. It's for you. I park my car beside the bridge and walk down to the beach. The sand is cold and wet, but I don't mind. I've been walking for hours and I'm ready to get to the end of this. I kneel down and start digging through the sand. I can feel the bottle at the bottom, just out of reach. I dig faster, my fingers scraping against the bottle. I finally grab it and pull it out of the sand. I brush off the sand and open the bottle. Inside is a letter and a piece of paper with a map on it. I unfold the map and see that it leads to a hidden treasure. I follow the map to a small cove and find a chest filled with gold coins and jewels. I carefully open the chest and take out a handful of the treasures. I know I should leave some for others, but I",

I am being sent to the wilderness, a place far away from civilization, for 20 years. I cannot believe that this is really happening. I have so many questions and fears running through my mind.\n\nI am leaving behind everything I know and love, my family, friends, and home. The thought of never seeing them again is heartbreaking.

        "The running faucet The faucet had a third knob. She tried the knob on the left, and hot water came out of the faucet. Just as she was about to turn off the faucet, she heard a voice from behind. \"Don't turn it off yet.\" The woman turned around and saw a man in a black suit standing there. \"I'm the spirit of the faucet. I've been waiting for you for a long time.\" The woman was shocked and asked, \"What do you want?\" \"I want to tell you a story,\" the spirit replied. \"This faucet has been here for many years, and many people have used it. But no one has ever noticed me before. I'm just a spirit, but I have a lot of stories to tell. You can hear them if you listen carefully to the sound of the water when the faucet is turned on.\" The woman was intrigued and turned on the faucet.
