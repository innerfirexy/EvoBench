        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an expert on China's",

She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties. But in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the head or hand.

It also said such groups were more at risk of developing thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders that hindered the blood's ability to carry oxygen.

The City watchdog also interviewed 40,000 people about their credit card use. Its interim findings include: The watchdog said while there was strong competition for some customers and products, other customers were not being targeted. Providers were quick to intervene when customers missed payments as they were \"extremely unprofitable\", but the same was not true of those just getting by. Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, which runs National Debtline, said: \"The FCA is absolutely right to be concerned about the 1.6 million people who are just about surviving by making minimum payments, often on multiple credit cards. \"As the report highlights, credit card companies usually intervene effectively to help customers who begin to miss payments, and many work closely with debt",

In particular, police tended to neglect cases where suspects did not use violence but tried to control their victim in other ways such as by making threats.

Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are capable of flying at high speeds due to a combination of factors, including their design, propulsion, and control systems.\n\n1. Design: Most drones are equipped with lightweight, high-performance motors and propellers that provide the necessary thrust for rapid flight. They often have a lightweight frame made of materials like carbon fiber, which reduces weight without compromising strength.\n\n2. Propulsion: Many modern drones use brushless motors, which are more efficient and powerful compared to traditional brushed motors. These motors can spin the propellers at high speeds, generating",

Fewer than one in 10 took the maximum amount allowed by law, and most took some combination of paid and unpaid leave.

Additionally, men who took more time off tended to have higher levels of job satisfaction and were less likely to report plans to quit their jobs. \n\nBased on this information, what can be inferred about the current paternity leave policies in the surveyed organization? The survey suggests that the paternity leave policies in the surveyed organization may not be fully utilized or equitable. A significant portion of new fathers, almost a quarter, did not take any paternity leave at all, indicating either a lack of awareness or a choice not to use the available leave.

These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy clients to hide their assets. The bank said it was cooperating fully with the investigation. It added that it had no evidence of any wrongdoing. The investigation is focused on a small number of accounts, UBS said.

But they have been used in the past by wealthy clients looking to avoid taxes or avoid detection by authorities. In 2008, the bank faced a major scandal when it was revealed that about 11,000 accounts held by US clients were being kept secret. The revelation led to a fine of $783m and a loss of reputation for the bank. The current investigation is believed to be related to that previous scandal. How do bearer bonds work?

Developer PegasusLife wants to replace it with a block of 32 apartments and a spa. But residents are fighting plans, saying the hotel has historical significance. \n\nQuestion: Why is there such a fight to save the Lyndhurst Park Hotel?\nThe fight to save the Lyndhurst Park Hotel is due to the developer's proposal to replace it with a block of 32 apartments and a spa, which residents believe goes against the hotel's historical significance. The hotel has a connection to Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson, who is said to have visited the site, making it a notable part of local history.
