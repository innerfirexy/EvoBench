Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an expert on China's ethnic policy",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race.

On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties. But in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the head or hand.

Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. \"The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa \u00a3100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,\" he said.

The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: \"One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. \"They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours - they aren't,\" he added. \"We are actually bringing down the hours that they work.

Ports have refused to accept Hanjin cargoes without guarantees that port fees will be paid. However, creditors, banks and the South Korean government are all reluctant to put up the cash. The global economic downturn, fierce competition and falling prices has hit profits across the cargo shipping industry and Hanjin collapsed with debts of about $5.4bn (\u00c2\u00a34.1bn) last month.

The research was conducted by the University of Cambridge, which found that 44% of domestic abuse incidents were recorded as \u2018no crime\u2019.\nThe report states: \u201cA significant proportion of domestic abuse incidents are not recorded as crimes (44%) or are recorded as another type of crime (26%).\n\u201cOf those incidents recorded as a crime, only a minority (38%) are recorded as being domestic abuse.\n\u201cThe remaining 62% of incidents recorded as crimes were not recorded as domestic abuse, even though domestic abuse is the most common",
        "The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two. The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house and is due to be approved by the upper house on Wednesday.\n\"The bill to revise the Japanese constitution is a very serious step,\" said Mr Abe, who was prime minister from 2006-2007. \"It will be a huge change.\"\nHe said that Japan should not have a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to its security policy.\n\"I think we need to consider what kind of role we can play in the world,\" he said.\nThe bill would replace Article 9 of the constitution, which prohibits Japan from using force or threatening to use it as a means of settling international disputes. It would allow the country to use military force to defend itself and allies, as well as to contribute to peacekeeping operations.\nCritics say the bill could lead to an expansion of Japan's military role, and could make it easier",

        "The site is believed to contain thousands of copies of a video game called ET The Extra-Terrestrial. A company called Atari made the game in 1982 for the Atari 2600. The game was so bad that it caused a massive crash in Atari's stock price.\nIt seems that Atari buried 4,000 copies of the game in the landfill because of the huge loss they took on it. The video game was so bad that it was never even released for sale. Atari wanted to get rid of all the copies before the public found out about their failure. The company spent $300,000 to bury the game and the rest of their inventory at the landfill. It was not until recently that someone discovered the location of the burial site. A group of treasure hunters is trying to dig up the games to sell them to collectors. The only problem is that Atari still owns the rights to the game and could sue the treasure hunters if they",
