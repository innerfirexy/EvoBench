This is different from other methods for variable computation that compute over multiple time steps. The proposed method is called \"variable computation over multiple units\" (VCMU), and it is based on the idea of using multiple units to compute",
        "This paper discussses applying an information bottleneck to deep networks using a variational lower bound and reparameterization trick. The paper is well written and the examples are compelling. The main idea is to use an information bottleneck to regularize",
        "This paper proposes the neural noisy channel model, P(x|y), where (x, y) is a input-to-out sequence pair,  based on the authors' previous work on neural channel models. P(x|y) is a probabilistic model that maps the input sequence y to the corresponding output sequence x, and is trained using maximum likelihood estimation. The model is",
        "This paper builds on the work of Weston (2016), using End-to-end memory network models for a limited form of dialogue with teacher feedback. As the authors state, the goal of this work is to investigate the effectiveness of using an end-to-end memory network model to generate responses to a prompt, with the help of a teacher who provides feedback on",
        "This paper extends the GAN framework to allow for latent variables. The observed data set is expanded by drawing latent variables z from a conditional distribution q(z|x). The joint distribution p(x,z) is learned by maximizing the log-likelihood of the observed data set. The paper also proposes a new loss function for training the GAN, which encourages the generator",
        "This paper introduces a simulator and a set of synthetic tasks for evaluating a dialogue agent's ability to learn from user feedback. For solving these tasks, the paper uses memory-augmented neural networks, which can maintain a dialogue history and use it to improve their responses. The authors evaluate their approach on a dataset",
        "This paper proposes a design principle for computation blocks in convolutional networks based on repeated application of expand and join operations resulting in a fractal-like structure. \n\nThis paper is an interesting read as it presents a new design principle for computation blocks in convolutional networks. The authors propose a new operation",
        "This paper studies the energy landscape of the loss function in neural networks.  It is generally clearly written and nicely provides intuitions for the results.  One main contribution is to show that the level set of the loss function can be approximated by a sigmoid function, which can be useful for optimization.\n\nHowever, there are some points that",
        "This paper provides a simple method to handle action repetitions. They make the action a tuple (a,x), where a is the action chosen, and x the number of repetitions. Over time, the algorithm will learn to choose actions with higher repetitions, as they are more likely to lead to rewards.\n\nThe algorithm starts by initializing the value function for",
        "This paper proposed a proximal (quasi-) Newton\u2019s method to learn binary DNN. The main contribution is to combine pre-conditioning with binarization in a proximal framework, which allows to handle the non-convex optimization problem of binary DNN. The authors show that their method can achieve the same level of accuracy as state-of-the-art methods",
        "This paper is a parallel work to Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching. The main solution of both papers is introducing autoencoder into GANs, which is a simple yet effective way to improve the training of GANs. However, there are some differences in the specific implementation details. In this paper,"
