The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge.

It's like a mini computer that you can carry around in your pocket.\"\n\n\"Ah, I see,\" the person from around 100-500 CE says, still seeming a bit confused. \"So it's like a box that can connect you to the world and all its knowledge, and you can carry it with you wherever you go.

        "A little girl helps her neighbor overcome his vow of silence he made after his wife passed away 40 years ago. I've lived in the house next door to the one where the little girl lives for 40 years. I've never spoken to anyone in the house, not even the little girl.
