        "This paper considers the problem of model-based policy search. The authors \nconsider the use of Bayesian Neural Networks to learn a model of the environment\nand advocate the use of a reinforcement learning algorithm to search for an optimal\npolicy. They propose an approach called Bayesian Inverse Reinforcement Learning (BIRL)\nto find the optimal policy",
        "This paper describes a new way of variable computation, which uses a different number of units depending on the input. This is different from other methods for variable computation that compute over multiple time steps. The new method, called Scalable Variable Computation (SVC), can be used to model a wide range of real-world systems, such as biological systems, social",
        "This paper discussses applying an information bottleneck to deep networks using a variational lower bound and reparameterization trick. The paper is well written and the examples are compelling. Highly recommended!\nThe main idea is to apply an information bottleneck to",
        "This paper proposes the neural noisy channel model, P(x|y), where (x, y) is a input-to-out sequence pair,  based on the authors' research on the relationship between the input-output pairs and the noisy channels. \"The paper provides a new model for sequence-to-sequence generation, which is based on the concept of noisy channels. The model is",
        "This paper builds on the work of Weston (2016), using End-to-end memory network models for a limited form of dialogue with teacher feedback. As the authors state, the system's knowledge remains confined to a local domain, and generalization across domains still presents a major challenge. However, the paper demonstrates that by combining the teacher-feedback mechanism with an end-to-end memory network,",
        "This paper extends the GAN framework to allow for latent variables. The observed data set is expanded by drawing latent variables z from a conditional distribution q(z|x). The joint distribution of x and z is then modelled by p(x, z), and the generative adversarial network learns this distribution.\nThe key idea in MAN is to allow for a discrete",
        "This paper introduces a simulator and a set of synthetic tasks for evaluating a dialogue agent's ability to learn from user feedback. For solving these tasks, the paper uses memory-based models that incrementally build a representation of the domain and an internal model of the user's goals and preferences. The paper provides a",
        "This paper proposes a design principle for computation blocks in convolutional networks based on repeated application of expand and join operations resulting in a fractal-like structure. \n\nThis paper is a technical report and does not have an official citation format. The paper was first presented at the 2015 IEEE Conference on",
        "This paper studies the energy landscape of the loss function in neural networks.  It is generally clearly written and nicely provides intuitions for the results.  One main contribution is to show that the level of chaos in the energy landscape of the loss function in a neural network is related to the number of local minima, and",
        "This paper provides a simple method to handle action repetitions. They make the action a tuple (a,x), where a is the action chosen, and x the number of repetitions. Over time the system will recognize that certain actions are repetitions of other actions and will start to apply the repetition rules.\nThe second algorithm is a bit more complex",
        "This paper proposed a proximal (quasi-) Newton\u2019s method to learn binary DNN. The main contribution is to combine pre-conditioning with binarization in a proximal framework, which leads to a more efficient and practical algorithm compared to the existing DNN approximation methods. The pre-conditioning technique introduces a linear operator A: X \u2192 Y,",
        "This paper is a parallel work to Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching. The main solution of both papers is introducing autoencoder into generative adversarial networks (GANs) to improve their performance. However, the solution in the second paper is more detailed and more clear. Therefore, I recommend you to read"
