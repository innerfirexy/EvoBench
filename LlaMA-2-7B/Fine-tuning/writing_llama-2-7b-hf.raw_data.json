        "Within a year of birth every parent receives a small gift or note from their 18yo child via time travel. You don't. When your 18yo finally arrives you also receive your gift. It is a silver ring, engraved with your family initials, that allows you to go back in time and witness a year in your child's life.\nHowever, you can only visit your family on the day they receive their gift.\nYour 18yo is your family's most important possession.
