        "This paper describes a new way of variable computation, which uses a different number of units depending on the variable. It is named the 25/12 approach, as it uses two different types of variable groups: the first is used for computation of small numbers, the second for computation of large numbers. The latter type of variable uses up to",
        "This paper presents a brief description of how the method works. Because this article is published by \u201cMDPI\u201d, an electronic publication, a PDF is attached at the end of the article. The original manuscript was submitted for review to",
        "This paper proposes the neural noisy channel model, P(x|y), where (x, y) is a input-to-out sequence pair, \u03b5_x_j is the noisy (with the independent and identically distributed Gaussian process) input data of length and \u03b5_y_j is the noisy output data of length . We denote \u03b5_x_j and \u03b5_y_j as noisy inputs and outputs respectively.\nThen, we",
        "This paper builds on the work of Weston (2016), using End-to-end memory network architecture and providing experimental validation to show the ability to learn and classify in various categories that we can distinguish. Based on real-time learning, we show that End-to-end memory network can help classifying learning and recall in the field of Artificial Intelligence.\nWe show that there are different",
        "This paper extends the GAN framework to allow for latent variables. The observed data set is expanded by drawing latent variables z from a conditional distribution q(z|x). The latent variables then form a latent space. We extend the GAN objective to a latent variable GAN to control the distribution of the latent variables.\nIn Figure 1a we can think",
        "This paper introduces a simulator and a set of synthetic tasks for evaluating a dialogue agent's ability to respond to spoken commands in context. It introduces the dialogue agent which is an artificial agent able to generate natural and coherent responses to spoken commands. The simulator supports the dialogue agent by generating contexts,",
        "This paper proposes a design principle for computation blocks in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The principle states: compute blocks should process the full set of signal intensities in an image. This design principle is based on the principle of computation blocks in analog VLSI circuits (e.g., ICs). By this principle and",
        "This paper studies the energy landscape of the loss function in neural networks.  It is generally recognised that loss functions have complex energy landscapes in their vicinities, whose energy and gradient levels are different in various areas depending on the choice of loss function.\nThis paper investigates what features of specific loss functions enable the network to have energy",
        "This paper provides a simple method to handle action repetitions. They make the action a tuple (a,x), where a is the action chosen, and x the number of repetitions of the action. We will call such sequences action-repetitives.\nFurther we will introduce repetitive strategies for action repetitions, in other words ways of choosing an action by a certain number",
        "This paper proposed a proximal (quasi-) Newton\u2019s method to learn binary DNN. The main contribution of this paper is to use the binary DNN to optimize non-binary binary DNN optimization. For each of the binary DNN input, the proposed algorithm can efficiently represent its weight by the output vector from the DNN.",
        "This paper is a parallel work to Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching. The main solution of both papers is introducing a novel form of gradient to train generative adversarial networks (GANs). This paper improves the GAN adversary networks by introducing adaptive learning of gradient. The proposed algorithm can be"
