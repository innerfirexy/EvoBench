Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge.

        "Life and Death decide to switch places for a time to see which of their jobs is harder. Death looked across the stars, at the glowing sun, and thought, \"If I'd wanted to see something like this I'd have been a sun, not a death.\" Death looked from star to star in the sky. It was an endless list of things that a person didn't and wouldn't do and there was one less thing he did or would do. Death looked the long list of \"won'ts\" and he thought, \"This won't bring me home. This won't bring you home.\" He stood on the earth looking about the sky and he decided to change jobs. He took on the role of Life, so long as life would go on; he decided to take the lead and let life go on. Death got on his horse and he rode to Life's house.

I felt the most indescribably sense of pleasure in slaying Mia, a girl she had killed, which she'd also taken care of 2 years ago in Dryad forest. She'd taken care of that guy with two bone's slices and she looked happy at the time when she said that. However, the moment she saw me, the moment I killed the first one, her eyes turned into pure hatred for me. I used a knife on her neck and her body fell on the ground while the blood dripped off onto the ground like rain.",

Though her slightly hunched spine might have been mistaken for the hunched back of her twin sister, she was the elder of the two. Death stood by her, leaning against a pear tree. The tree, although green, was a little grey. It was dying to produce the red apples that made it well-known by all as not long since had become old. Both the young sisters were known for that fact also, though not all the same in the way a pear tree can be. Both shared in a bit of the other\u2019s pain. Pain in the way that the tree could suffer.
