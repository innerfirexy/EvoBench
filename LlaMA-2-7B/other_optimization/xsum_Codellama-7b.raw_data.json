China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region.

These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy clients to potentially hide assets. \"We are cooperating with the authorities in these investigations,\" the bank said. The fresh investigation by the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York and from the US Securities and Exchange Commission comes after UBS paid $780m (\u00c2\u00a3512m) in 2009 to settle a separate Justice Department tax-evasion probe. And it comes as authorities in a range of countries are considering examining HSBC's actions in helping more than 100,000 wealthy individuals avoid paying tax.

The research found that although most domestic abuse incidents were handled in a \"professional\" way, some officers still displayed \"negative and uninformed\" attitudes. In particular, police tended to neglect cases where suspects did not use violence but tried to control their victim in other ways such as by making threats. The report said: \"A tendency for the police to focus on physical violence and what has occurred at the current incident can result in them missing abuse which is characterised not by physical violence and injury but by continuous coercion and control in other forms.\" The researchers concluded that if risk was not assessed properly some cases would \"slip",

        "A website polled users as to which country he should tour next, with no restrictions on the nations that could be voted on. There are now more than 250 countries to vote for though they are only allowed to vote for three at a time.\nSome users even wondered whether some countries should be ranked and to what extent they should be penalised due to recent events. The list of candidates and the votes for each are available on the poll, so those looking to weigh their options could do so, too. And there\u2019s one vote per person if they're logged in, so it's an easy to use, non-committal poll for people to try out the new site.\nThe next poll is on a different theme with each vote. We\u2019re not sure whether any of those voting on this one will travel to Tajikistan so it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll be looking at their travel plans and taking in the country",

        "Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces were reported as saying that a lack of senior leadership had held the profession back and also that there was a feeling of disengagement with the public and a lack of confidence across the force in engaging with them.\nIn addition to the challenges the police face, issues within the college also required addressing with respect to the following issues:\nThe number of young offenders was increasing, a trend that would be exacerbated with increases in the number of children being educated at school.\nThere was a shortage of staff in a number of policing functions.\nIn addition, an issue of concern was the level of professional inbreeding in the police, so that there were a number of officers who were seen, not at all unfairly, as coming from the same family tree.\nIn the last few years",

        "The European Challenge Tour event will be part of a big week in the season with both the US PGA Championship and Women's British Open also being played here in August.\nAnd I'm certain that with a prize purse of around $3.3 million, plus a further $450,000 for golf's leading women professional, the European Tour will be a major feature of next year's Ryder Cup in Gleneagles.\nThe fact that the European Tour is also expanding this event has also helped the golfing world discover Raven's Point Golf Club, which has not been played as recently as the Ryder Cup. And as soon as this magnificent course emerges from its winter slumber, it is certain to be one of Europe's best, perhaps even as good a challenge as the Old Course at St. Andrews.\nBut there's still a long, long way to go.\n",

And they made no attempt to take the money.\n\nBut the German newspapers are not very clear on this detail. They say that the dead man was a Spanish diplomat, and it is hinted that this explains the apparent rushed disassembly of the plane but there's no explanation given of why the money is missing. \"Perhaps the bankers who had paid him on arrival to his flight did not wish to have his death traced back to him,\" remarks the Express, and while this is certainly possible, it seems odd that no one would have mentioned the money to the German police. I wonder if it was stowed away in the luggage of the diplomat and then left behind when he flew?\n\nBut however this is, it is certainly",

Developer Robert Carle, who has a long-time interest in the building through its history, began restoration about 25 years ago, after visiting the former home of the Huggins family in England. During his last trip to Nassau, a Huggins cousin revealed she was the grandchild of Mrs. Huggins. It had been 100 years since the family left Nassau. In 1878 the Huggins took over the property from John H. Bingham who was the last known resident of the old hotel that dated back to 1811, replacing the previous structure. A photo of the Bing-Huggins hotel is held in the library of the Historical Society in New York. It is described as an \u201cexcellent example of Federal style with classic"
