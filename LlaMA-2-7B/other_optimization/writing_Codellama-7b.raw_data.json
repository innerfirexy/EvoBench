        "Life and Death decide to switch places for a time to see which of their jobs is harder. Death looked across the stars, at the glowing heart of the sun. Life stared right into Death\u2019s eyes. Death flicked his eyes away. Life started talking and Death started listening intently.\nLife: \u201cWhy, that\u2019s amazing. I always wondered why we, all of us, die. And it\u2019s not just us, it\u2019s the insects and fish and all the species. Why this huge loss of life? Isn\u2019t life wonderful, Death?\u201d\nDeath: \u201cLife is wonderful; however, I\u2019ve not lived a very exciting life; there are other things that are much more interesting.\u201d\nLife: \u201cBut you have the chance to see each and every one of us go away.

        "You are a compulsive liar. Convince me you are not. In order to be a good liar-the best liar-you must practice, practice, practice. Because a skill cannot be created in less than a week, you cannot be a good liar by yourself. That's fine. Your mentor can help you be the best. But you have to accept the mentor's expertise if you want to become a strong liar. Do you accept that?\"\n\"No, I don't, Mr. Jones,\" he replied. \"I don't think my mentor should be able to teach me, and you should be able to do it.

        "Your ascent into sanity The thrill of defeating the pure incarnation of evil vibrated through every inch of my body. I can still hear the sound his chest made as he took the blow to the heart--as if the earth itself had punished him. _My_ victory would have been a mere abstraction. He had done nothing. _I_ had done everything. _I_. There was no doubt in my mind that I had to be the one to save humanity, even if I had to destroy it by the end.\nBut what did it matter? At that point, the only person who had ever really _mattered_ had been destroyed.\nI hadn't realized the extent to which my world had changed until after I finished watching what happened next.\nIt didn't matter to me, any more.\nI didn't care that she had killed those who had protected me.

In fact before he died he had no words for you at all.\nI could never understand why.

It was you that always ended up in trouble.\nMy dad was a junkie who went missing for a couple of years after a car crash when you were little.

        "Living in the worst possible timeline / If there is a parallel universe for every possible outcome, there must be one with the worst possible outcomes.\nI believe it to be true. There is a lot of research supporting my theory. For example, the Fermi Paradox, which is the lack of evidence for intelligent life beyond Earth. I also believe the paradox can also be solved using the parallel universe theory. The paradox is caused by intelligent life being in one instance less than the population limit to sustain life, and then when we search for it in other instances it simply doesn\u2019t show up.\nOne solution to this is that Earth, with its biological diversity, is overpopulated compared to the other planets. Therefore, intelligent life does exist, but we cannot find it by searching like we are doing. If we changed our methods, search more aggressively for it on a smaller planet, that\u2019s",

        "A 101-year old bottle washed up on a beach with a letter inside. It's for you. I parked the van in the backyard of my uncle's house. He'd never told me just what the letter said, but I wanted to find out on my own. I held it up to my face for a better look. Then I turned it upside down, spilling the ink from the open bottle. The paper was still soaked after more than a hundred years, no doubt the result of the bottle washing into the sea, but there had been lots of things more important than that to occupy its contents. Above the letter was some kind of symbol, and what it said wasn't just a message: _The name of the recipient was in the middle. Someone who knew very well is waiting to meet with you, and will be standing in your future. Do it if you want",

Now every man is accountable for every act.\nMy thoughts are as follows: How can this have gone so wrong? In the name of an almighty God, how came this to happen?
