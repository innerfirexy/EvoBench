This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest. I knew her hatchlings would be too young to fend for themselves. I found them easily. She hadn't moved them since I stumbled upon them the first time, likely too weak from the cancer.",

The faded sun rose through the horizon in the smog filled skies of Rome. I trudged through beggars and merchants on my way to another hard day at the docks. The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The long walk to work provided ample time to daydream about warm meals and deep sleep, luxuries of a distant past. But I didn't have time to daydream today. I couldn't afford to be late. Again.

Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge.
