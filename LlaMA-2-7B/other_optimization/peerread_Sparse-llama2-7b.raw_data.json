        "This paper proposes the neural noisy channel model, P(x|y), where (x, y) is a input-to-out sequence pair, \uf0fb, \uf0f9, and \uf0fa indicate the different type of components or channels involved in the noise system, and the probability of the output state, P\u0304, after an input-to-out sequence processing, is computed as a weighted sum of many",
        "This paper builds on the work of Weston (2016), using End-to-end memory network (W-LAN) and deep convolutional neural network (DCN) to investigate the interaction effects between these two modules within the visual object recognition paradigm. W-LAN consists of three stages of visual input processing; each stage uses one of the following modules or combination thereof: 1,2-D input to W-LA, W-LA",
        "This paper extends the GAN framework to allow for latent variables. The observed data set is expanded by drawing latent variables z from a conditional distribution q(z|x). We explore the effects of latent variables on the GAN framework. We investigate several GAN scenarios on latent variable data sets. GANs are very widely used to solve problems in the",
        "This paper introduces a simulator and a set of synthetic tasks for evaluating a dialogue agent's ability to generate dialogue that is realistic. It is a large collection of conversational interactions performed with humans. This collection of tasks requires agents to engage in two-way conversations that allow for them to be flexible, context-aware,",
        "This paper proposes a design principle for computation blocks in convolutional machine learning which makes it much easier to implement neural computation blocks and integrate large convolutional models, which can be a barrier to deployment. It also solves other challenges in system design, such as the data rate, reliability, and power",
        "This paper studies the energy landscape of the loss function in neural networks.  It is generally accepted that minimizing the cost of an evaluation, expressed by the accuracy of a prediction model, can increase the accuracy.  The work reported here uses the same toolkit to benchmark itself against. The authors have created a benchmark database from the",
        "This paper provides a simple method to handle action repetitions. They make the action a tuple (a,x), where a is the action chosen, and x the number of repetitions the player is allowed.\nThis paper provides a simple method to handle action repetitions. They make the action a tuple (a,x), where a is the action chosen, and x the",
        "This paper proposed a proximal (quasi-) Newton\u2019s method to learn binary DNN. The main contribution of the paper is the implementation of a proximal nonlinear convergence criteria. The quasi-Newton\u2019s algorithm was used to solve an equation involving hyperparameter of DNN. Binary DNN is an advanced machine-learning technology, which was created to solve",
        "This paper is a parallel work to Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching. The main solution of both papers is introducing a form of feature matching based on denoising technique.\nWith a lot of efforts, Actor-Critic has been a successful learning framework. In fact, Actor-Critic has made a lot of contributions"
