Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle;",

China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts",

        "OUP analysed more than 120,421 short stories by children aged between five and 13 years old, collected by the UK Cognitive Science and Developmental Psychology Network during a randomised two-stage screening survey undertaken in 1997. All the short stories were written by British and Irish teachers. They were then analysed in depth by 24 independent researchers using a standardised analysis tool.\n\nThe studies found that in English-speaking countries children do produce stories and they produce them in a variety of ways. As the researchers found, there are similarities in how the stories were organised and in what the stories were about. And there is a correlation between the frequency of story production and the cognitive state of the child.

        "Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, a numeracy test and a test of knowledge of British laws. The last will replace the current legal A-level as a requirement for licensing; the first three will not.\n\nIt is not clear how the new test will be scored. Clearly, it would need to dovetail with a new A-level. But how could students who do poorly on the test get those grades? Or even enter? I do not see any option of giving students who fail the tests the grade they should have received had they passed. There will be an incentive: do badly on the test and get a good grade. This raises the question: should it be a zero lower (this is common in the USA) or a zero upper. I am not in favor of a zero lower, but a zero upper would seem",

        "A website polled users as to which country he should tour next, with no restrictions on the nations that could be voted on. There are now about 15,000 users, with many more watching the polling. At any moment, a user can either be a voter with a vote for a given country, or an onlooker (and the votes are anonymous). After one user picks a country, the number of votes available increases by one. With this method, the number of votes is a decreasing function of time.\n\nThe results are impressive: if the users who voted on Germany, Spain, Italy, France and the Netherlands were all onlookers, their vote would be determined by Germany, Spain, Italy, France and the Netherlands.

        "Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces who declined to speak said they were also worried that the force's in-house reports had not included all the relevant risk factors or included superfluous ones and that they had failed to take the threat into account when planning for manpower and equipment. \"This is a concern,\" said Tim Fry, a police training consultant who has worked within at least 12 neighbourhood policing teams across the country. \"It doesn't mean the programme is not working or a problem with the model. It just means it is the nature of the work.\"\n\n\"The problem isn't that there is a shortage of police. It is that the police haven't been asked to go further and not just focus on serious crime,\" said Fry. \"We see an increasing shift in thinking, which goes beyond the",

        "The site is believed to contain thousands of copies of a video game called ET The Extra-Terrestrial. A company called Atari Entertainment licensed it to them in 1981. The videogame was developed by the UCLA Computer Science Department (Cosmos Research Lab) in an attempt to create a digital form of an amusing and entertaining electronic bumper car machine. It was first shown to the public in 1981, with the original version being called \"ET\", and later renamed to \"ET The Extra-Terrestrial\". While not an exact copy of the original game, it contains most of the same features, like 13 bumper cars and the green background pattern that runs across them. It was the subject of much controversy as the game, though written in basic, uses the \"EasterEgg\" coding feature in its programming to display an ASCII text image of the UCLA",

He confirmed that the river level reached 10ft. above previous high tide but said it was 'not unusual' for this to",
        "The Crawick Multiverse, designed by renowned artist Charles Jencks, has been created with materials found on the site in Dumfries and western Glasgow. The idea of the sculpture comes from the words in a poem by Henry Kerr, who wrote it at Dumfries, on the west of the Scottish Highland and north of Dumfriesshire, in April 1862. The meaning of the poem, which is named Kerr's Craw, is clear as to what Jencks seeks to achieve.\n\nThe Multiverse, is a project that brings together a new generation of artists using landmarks and material from local heritage sites and other natural settings to recreate an infinite number.\n\nThe multiverse includes both natural and artificial sites, including Stonehaven, Edinburgh, Paisley Park, Glasgow and Dumfries.
