The authors do not attempt to model the effects of the different factors on the model. The",
        "This paper shows how policy gradient and Q-Learning may be combined together, improving learning as demonstrated in particular in the Atari Learning Environment. The core idea is to note that entropy is a measure of how much information is contained in a probability distribution. This in turn means that entropy can be used as a",
        "This paper clearly lays out the recipe for a family of invertible density models, explores a few extensions, and demonstrates the overall power of the approach. The work is building closely on the seminal paper of [@Bishop2006] and the recent paper of [@Krishnamurthy2012].\n\n[**Keywords:**]{} Invertible Density, Nonparametric Bayes, Nonparametric Bayesian Inference, Density Estimation, Invertible Gamma Process, Invertible Dirichlet Process,",
        "This paper extends batch normalization successfully to RNNs where batch normalization has previously failed or done poorly. The experiments and datasets tackled show definitively the improvement that batch norm LSTMs can bring to RNNs.\n\n### Summary\n\n1.  Batch normalization has been a big success for convolutional neural networks.\n2.  Batch normalization has",
        "This paper describes a way to speed up convergence through sudden increases of otherwise monotonically decreasing learning rates. Several techniques are presented in a clear way and parameterized method is proposed and evaluated on the MNIST dataset.\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nIn machine learning, the performance of algorithms is often measured by their convergence speed. However, the convergence",
        "This paper proposes a weakly supervised, end-to-end neural network model for solving a challenging natural language understanding task. \nAs an extension of the Neural Programmer I (NPI) model, the NPI+ model is able to learn the mapping between natural language sentences and programs, which are executed on a set of predefined functions and",
        "This paper introduces a 'GPU-friendly' variant of A3C which relaxes some synchronicity constraints in the original A3C algorithm to make it more friendly to a high-performance GPU implementation. In addition, we provide a novel method to speed up A3C by leveraging the GPU memory hierarchy. Our experiments show that A3C with our GPU-friendly algorithm can achieve",
        "This paper presents an approach to learn to generate programs. Instead of directly trying to generate the program, the authors propose to train a neural net to estimate a fix set of attributes, which then condition the generation of the program. The authors also propose to learn the attributes of a program by training a neural net to predict",
        "This paper considers the problem of model-based policy search. The authors \nconsider the use of Bayesian Neural Networks to learn a model of the environment\nand advocate using the model to generate a set of policies. The authors \nshow that a policy is a solution to the problem if it is a fixed",
        "This paper describes a new way of variable computation, which uses a different number of units depending on the input. This is different from other methods for variable computation that compute over multiple time steps. The idea is to use a smaller number of units to compute the variable when the input is small, and a larger number when",
        "This paper discussses applying an information bottleneck to deep networks using a variational lower bound and reparameterization trick. The paper is well written and the examples are compelling. I like the idea of applying information bottleneck to deep networks,",
        "This paper proposes the neural noisy channel model, P(x|y), where (x, y) is a input-to-out sequence pair,  based on the authors' previous work in [@yu2018learning]. The model is an extension of the original neural noisy channel model in [@yu2018learning], where the input-to-out sequence pair is assumed to be independent.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows.",
        "This paper builds on the work of Weston (2016), using End-to-end memory network models for a limited form of dialogue with teacher feedback. As the authors state, they are not attempting to solve the full problem of dialogue with teacher feedback, but rather to use a simpler model to demonstrate the generality of the memory network approach. They use the",
        "This paper extends the GAN framework to allow for latent variables. The observed data set is expanded by drawing latent variables z from a conditional distribution q(z|x). The joint distribution p(x,z) is modeled by a generative model and a discriminator is trained to distinguish between real and fake data. The GAN is then trained to minimize the divergence",
        "This paper introduces a simulator and a set of synthetic tasks for evaluating a dialogue agent's ability to learn from user feedback. For solving these tasks, the paper uses memory-augmented neural networks. The simulator allows to generate a variety of user-agent dialogues, and to create training data from these dialogues. This training data",
        "This paper proposes a design principle for computation blocks in convolutional networks based on repeated application of expand and join operations resulting in a fractal-like structure. \n\nThis paper is based on the work of Krizhevsky et al. [1] where the authors proposed a deep convolutional network for object recognition. The network",
        "This paper studies the energy landscape of the loss function in neural networks.  It is generally clearly written and nicely provides intuitions for the results.  One main contribution is to show that the level sets of the loss function of a neural network can be approximately represented as a collection of spheres.  This is an interesting",
        "This paper provides a simple method to handle action repetitions. They make the action a tuple (a,x), where a is the action chosen, and x the number of repetitions. Over time, we expect that the repetitions will even out, so that the average number of repetitions is 1. We can then use the average number of repetitions as",
        "This paper proposed a proximal (quasi-) Newton\u2019s method to learn binary DNN. The main contribution is to combine pre-conditioning with binarization in a proximal framework. We show that the proposed method can solve a general form of binary DNN, which is a special case of a more general problem in nonlinear optimization.",
        "This paper is a parallel work to Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching. The main solution of both papers is introducing autoencoder into GANs.\n\nIn the original paper, the autoencoder is used as a discriminator. The input of the discriminator is the feature vector of the generated sample and the input"
