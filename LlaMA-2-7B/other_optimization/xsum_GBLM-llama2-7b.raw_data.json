Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region.

        "Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, a basic knowledge knowledge test, a motorway driving test, a night driving test and an independent driving test for private hire drivers. The consultation forms will also ask if a practical driving test should include a vision test. The revised proposals will be put on public display and comments welcomed by the 26 August.\nAn English language test would be compulsory before a theory test could be sat (although no test will be required on theory). The requirement applies to both the full theory test and the practical test, although the theory part can be passed with a driving skills test. However, this rule has been rejected by a number of industry figures. They believe a practical test should also carry with the English requirement.\nThis requirement would allow them to pass an English test and driving skills test. But those who have English skills",
        "The Saddlers looked more likely to take the lead in the first half, with Albion goalkeeper Jon McLaughlin keeping out Paul Snr's well-struck volley.\nBut it was instead Albion who took the lead following what can only be described as a lucky touch from the Albion player.\nHe was on the way back into the Albion goal when a long-range shot by Luke Dale was hit by McLaughlin, and the ball bounced off the Albster's outstretched leg, and went in via the post.\nMcLaughlin should never have got the touch, but he did, and then the Albster reacts as though he has been hit with a blast wave of anesthetic.\nLess than six minutes later, we were level at 2-2, thanks to a superb header by Nathan Craig.\nThe equaliser came after an Albster shot",

        "Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors.

        "The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two. The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house of parliament and is expected to be approved by the upper house.\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe has pushed for changes in Japan's military, pushing through the bill on a package of measures related to defense and nuclear policy after the military defeated a motion to amend the pacifist, post-war constitution.\nHowever some Japanese politicians, including several in Abe's own party, are opposed to the changes which would strengthen Japan's military, and would require approval in a vote at the United Nations to become official. Japan's constitution forbids war and specifies that any armed force on its territory should be done only in accordance with the United Nations.\nChinese nationalist Li Changxu said the legislative initiatives were counterproductive. \"When Japan is getting more",

That game became one of the biggest flops in video game history.\nBut Atari has been releasing video game copies and documents about ET in an effort to generate extra cash. Atari is currently suing Activision because the game maker is making copies of ET. A federal judge put the case on hold so Atari can focus on selling the game.\nBut the idea of ET returning is a bad idea. ET is the worst game to ever hit the market.
