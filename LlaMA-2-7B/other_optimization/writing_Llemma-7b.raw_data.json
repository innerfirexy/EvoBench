Death looked across the stars, at the glow of the galaxies beyond. \"Yours is a terrible job,\" he said, \"Your friends will never get to your funeral, and people who are important won't even mourn.\" He shook his head and said, \"It better be a funeral.\" She smiled. \"I knew it,\" he said, \"It must be one.\" She giggled.

Or would he be able to help us decide if they are 'correct', just for this example please. Thanks :)\n\n##### Share on other sites\n\nNo, he doesn't seem to think that the theories are necessarily wrong. He just says that they could very well be the case. There is no way to prove this, he says, since we only have one universe to experience, and we can only study ours and make predictions.\n\nHe claims that it would explain things such as why our universe can't create itself ex nihilo, and why consciousness is more than the sum of the basic parts it consists of.\n\nEdited by Amaton\n##### Share",

It was worse everyday when I was in 6th grade, I was always with the other kids playing basketball or going to the pool everyday. I was always with the other kids.

I was worried for the child but there were no adults anywhere to talk to. The silence of the house was loud and scary. The silence turned into the screaming of a baby. The scream was of a little girl that had been beaten unconscious. The baby was the only child in my family and she was my world. The adults never noticed the attack and I couldn't help her. I could have helped her but the shock of someone beating my baby was too much for me. I screamed at the adults for not caring but nobody heard me. They didn't care.
