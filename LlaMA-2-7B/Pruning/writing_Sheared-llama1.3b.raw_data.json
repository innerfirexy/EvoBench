The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze",

        "Life and Death decide to switch places for a time to see which of their jobs is harder. Death looked across the stars, at the glowing light of Deaths own lantern, and he found it hard to decide. Even harder than to decide which of Deaths jobs was harder. So he decided that he would become Death and kill his own mother.\nLife woke up the next morning. But then he woke up again. So he decided he was just dreaming. He had come back to sleep, for the third time that afternoon.\nLife awoke as he heard his mother's voice say, \"You're a pretty girl, Life. My boyfriend is going to love you.\" His mother, A.Life, had been saying this for years. But now he'd finally come to love her. And he thought he'd died.\nLife awakened as he heard his mother say, \"Your boyfriend is going to",

        "You are a compulsive liar. Convince me you are not. In order to be a good liar-the best liar-you must have lies. Lies are not simply a means to your ends. Instead, they're your goals. Your lies must be better than the truth. Lies take practice, though they don't take long to memorize. To the extent that you lie, do not expect it to come naturally. You will need to learn how to lie. And then you will need to learn how not to lie. You will need to learn the art of lying.\"\nSinfully cynical, audacious. You know just what you like, and what you want. You know exactly what people would think if they were able to know how much you know. You do not fear being found out. You don't care what others think; it won't change you. Your goal is to remain the strong",
        "Your ascent into sanity The thrill of defeating the pure incarnation of evil vibrated through every inch of my body. I could never have imagined that I could feel such emotions. As my feet came off the ground, the fear began to dissipate. As I looked around, I saw that I wasn\u2019t alone. I was standing on a set of stairs that took me up another level. But as I continued to ascend, my eyes turned to the left and caught sight of two large, muscular men. One was seated behind the other. This left me to wonder if I was hallucinating. I stood up, taking three steps forward, then stopped short, realizing that the two men stood in front of me. They were large, muscular, well-muscled men that were dressed in tattered blue shirts and trousers, and heavy blue coveralls. Their faces were",
        "Within a year of birth every parent receives a small gift or note from their 18yo child via time travel. You don't. You don't.\nThey want you to know how they value you and how they want to honor the legacy you are building as a father.\nYou don't. You don't. You don't. You don't.\nSure, the kids will have a lot to say about those things at different times. It will be clear, though, that they're still important and there may even be a lot they want to say about you at different stages as well-but only you know that.\nWhat makes a healthy father? A healthy-to-some father? It's a real person with real life problems and real people have real life.

        "A voice in the sky will tell you when you've left a place for the last time. You tell your SO goodbye and head out, and then one minute later they are back. You will know by a strange sound in the air - a high and deep note - that a voice in the sky has told them to leave, and, when you look back, they've gone. They didn't need a voice in the sky - they knew.\nAnd if you've gone in a different direction after losing a voice... well, you'll still hear that high note, too.\nIt's kind of silly, really, but also really interesting. I was thinking that if my boyfriend ever goes missing, he just has that same kind of high sound on his mobile every Friday - you know, like a voice from the sky or something.",

        "Living in the worst possible timeline / If there is a parallel universe for every possible outcome, there must be one with the worst possible outcomes. In that universe, if you\u2019re on the wrong end of an event, it leads to catastrophe. I believe that the worst possible outcome came to be during the final few years of the Cubs\u2019 championship run. I remember how it felt in July of 2003. I was up in Chicago with my buddies. We were celebrating with a bunch of Cub fans in a bar, and we were telling ourselves everything was gonna be ok. We were going to take care of those Red Sox, win the division and win the playoffs. Then, out of nowhere, the news came out that they\u2019d lost to San Diego. So we\u2019re walking out of the bar, the party is still going strong, it\u2019s a really nice Thursday night in July.",
        "The day Death died. A young girl sat on a park bench on a brightly colored autumn day. Though her slightly hunched back and dull features made her look very old, perhaps in her life it had been a happy one. This was confirmed by the happy little smile that was a constant feature of her face.\nThe girl was wearing a pinafore dress, a bright orange skirt and white blouse, and a pair of brown slippers on her feet. She was sitting in companionable silence when her eyes met Death\u2019s for the last time.\nBefore turning away, Death said \u201cYes, it was a happy life.\u201d\nWhen she finished her story she got up and went off, she thought that it was over. When she stopped at the corner of the street, she looked back at the bench and smiled. It was still empty. She stood there for a while, watching and thinking, and then she turned the corner and",

She felt the heat of her hand against her, and realized she had placed her own thumb on her leg.\nDon't leave me, you're my best friend. As the door closed behind the policeman, the girl noticed she was missing her hand. But suddenly, it was replaced by a familiar object.
