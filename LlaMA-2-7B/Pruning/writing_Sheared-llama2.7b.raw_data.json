This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest.

        "Meet & Greet/Weekly Question # 3: What do you look for in a WP response? What do I look for in someone\u2019s WP response? For example, an essay answering a question or talking about some topic that interests me.\nThis week\u2019s question is probably pretty obvious: What do you look for in a WP response? What do I look for in someone\u2019s WP response?\nAt face value, this second half of my question probably seems less obvious. I was actually quite surprised when I got the questions back, as I was surprised at what I found when answering the first half: basically, almost all my classmates seemed to respond to those questions with short answers of about 250-350 words. I was a little surprised, because when I read over some of the answers I gave when I received those 10 questions, they were a lot longer than those 100-",

        "You are a compulsive liar. Convince me you are not. In order to be a good liar-the best liar-you must be able to deceive others about your own character. The best liars do this routinely and without even realizing it. Of course it is difficult to deceive others about the basic features of your character-the physical, emotional, and intellectual personality. And yet it is often very easy to make the audience believe in something that has nothing to do with you. The most skilled and versatile liars are not just good at deceiving their own audience and manipulating them along lines of self-interest; they are good at manipulating the masses, with results that can be unforeseen and unpredictable to anyone but them.\nThe artful liar\u2019s trick is to avoid revealing the true nature of the deceit. Instead, the liar seeks to obsc",

        "A voice in the sky will tell you when you've left a place for the last time. You tell your SO goodbye and head out in a straight line. There is no scenery. You just see some blue hills through a haze. They look the same as a few years ago, you know. You've been going here. You know how to drive. You know where you should be going.

        "Living in the worst possible timeline / If there is a parallel universe for every possible outcome, there must be one with the worst possible outcomes.\nAt the time I was a teenager, I had developed extreme depression. It wasn\u2019t so much a diagnosis as a diagnosis that I never had to worry about. There was nothing that could be done to fix it. No doctors, no therapies, no medication. I tried therapy, for all of two sessions, and it did the opposite of what it should have done.\nI had been a competitive swimmer for my age group since I was eight years old. I had a love for the water and competitive swimming helped me to channel my love of the water into something productive. But after those first therapy sessions, I could no longer bring myself to swim. In that state of depression, I just felt like swimming was something stupid that I could",
        "The day Death died. A young girl sat on a park bench on a brightly colored autumn day. Though her slightly hunched back, dark eyes and dull hands were worn, she was clad in a gown that had seen her through the years, the ageing faded by time\u2019s magic. Yet she shuddered at the thought of time moving on. Now it was the hour of death. Time had been stilled in her world, and she was alone. Her mind raced with thoughts about what death was.

        "Explain a piece of modern technology to a person from around 100-500 CE. \"Look, are you even trying?!\" You'll find that the hardest thing is just explaining what a computer is, but also making sure to emphasize how useful it is in your society. The modern technology you should discuss will be determined by your year in the past as the technology of the early Roman Empire is a bit different. You should consider using this resource.\nHere are links to some modern technologies created by people born around 100 (BCE) through 500 (CE):\n100 -> 300: A horse-drawn carriage.\n200 -> 400: A flute or a bagpipe.\n400 -> 600: A chime or a fireworks firecracker.\n600 -> 800: A wind-up watch",

The second is even better.\nWhenever people say that our vow never meant much to us, or that the promises that we made our vows are meaningless, it gets under my skin.\nJust because a vow doesn't seem to mean much in the scheme of things doesn't mean that it doesn't mean something.\nWhen parents make vows they make all sorts of promises to their children.
