Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire",

        "Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, a learning history test, tutoring and workplace skills, and a pilot will see the number of schools in the area jump from about 40 to 66 schools following the new test. The test will be carried out in the borough (including the 30, 40 and 50% English learner area on the north bank of the Thames) over the next 7 years. This will enable schools to improve their English. TfL will also monitor schools to see the test measures being taken, with an objective to help schools identify the most effective route for improvement.\nThe map-reading assessment at TfL will see a learner running a learning history assessment on the map, covering 15 points throughout the student\u2019s lesson.\nThis mapping test also seeks teachers",

        "A website polled users as to which country he should tour next, with no restrictions on the nations that could be voted on. There are now 28 destinations (not counting Turkey) all of which are in Europe and most are even beyond the reach of most Americans \u2014 in other words, the destinations are most likely to be in the same country in the same time frame! What\u2019s the problem is that most of these countries, which are 30 to 40 percent European, still have no direct ties with American tourism and tourism can\u2019t come from outside the US even if they are from other parts of the world. This explains some of the reasons why Europe might not have a direct link to American tourism, even when they are in the US.\nToday I\u2019m talking about two nations: a group of poor countries called Portugal, and a group of middle-class countries called Turkey.\nTell me about that,",

        "Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces, one in London, an accounting firm and two police forces from Mumbai, had been investigated for assaults.\nThe investigation showed some alarming behaviour. There was repeated shouting, texting and chattering on both sides of the phone. One officer was able to calm people at the scene, with him even offering to share a bottle of whisky with the other officer if the other officer agreed. Officers were also involved in several conversational scenes.\nIn the first report, it was highlighted that police officers were making decisions about how the force was to act in the community instead of focusing on investigating the event. They were more focused on safety and on making sure that other officers understood how to act.\nThe police said that in the face of the violence the force would focus on dealing",
