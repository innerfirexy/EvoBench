        "This paper describes a way to speed up convergence through sudden increases of otherwise monotonically decreasing learning rates. Several techniques are presented in a clear way and parameterized method is proposed and evaluated on a benchmark AITB dataset with mixed classification and regression tasks. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other",
        "This paper proposes a weakly supervised, end-to-end neural network model for solving a challenging natural language understanding task. \nAs an extension of the Neural Programmer's Notebook (NPN) architecture, the proposed model introduces self-attention mechanisms to improve the model's ability to capture the meaning of text in a variety of domains.\n\nThe proposed model achieves",
        "This paper introduces a 'GPU-friendly' variant of A3C which relaxes some synchronicity constraints in the original A3C algorithm to make it more friendly to a high-performance GPU architecture. A3C employs a linear-time algorithm to compute the optimal solution for a multi-agent system in which actions are transmitted between agents in a strictly predetermined order. Our variant",
        "This paper presents an approach to learn to generate programs. Instead of directly trying to generate the program, the authors propose to train a neural net to estimate a fix set of attributes, which then conditionally generate the program at run time. This approach has the potential to be more flexible and adaptable to changing requirements and environments.\nThe approach",
        "This paper considers the problem of model-based policy search. The authors \nconsider the use of Bayesian Neural Networks to learn a model of the environment\nand advocate for a hybrid approach of model-based and rule-based policy search.\nThe paper includes experiments on real-world driving scenarios, showing the successful use\nof the proposed approach in finding",
        "This paper describes a new way of variable computation, which uses a different number of units depending on the input. This is different from other methods for variable computation that compute over multiple time steps. The new method builds on the idea of variable computation over time and exploits the inherent parallelism in the problem by dividing the units",
        "This paper discussses applying an information bottleneck to deep networks using a variational lower bound and reparameterization trick. The paper is well written and the examples are compelling, showing how information bottlenecking can help alleviate the curse of dimensionality",
        "This paper proposes the neural noisy channel model, P(x|y), where (x, y) is a input-to-out sequence pair,  based on the authors' previous work on a multi-output neural network model, P(w|x), where w is the output sequence of a separate neural network. P(x|y), as opposed to P(w|x), is a noise model that incorporates channel distortions",
        "This paper builds on the work of Weston (2016), using End-to-end memory network models for a limited form of dialogue with teacher feedback. As the authors state, their approach can provide feedback in real-time to the learner, allowing the learner to refine their understanding of the topic. In their previous research, the authors found that using natural language processing and",
        "This paper extends the GAN framework to allow for latent variables. The observed data set is expanded by drawing latent variables z from a conditional distribution q(z|x). The joint distribution of the latent variables and the observed data x is then approximated by a normal distribution. The approximation is made using a combination of a latent factor G,",
        "This paper introduces a simulator and a set of synthetic tasks for evaluating a dialogue agent's ability to learn from user feedback. For solving these tasks, the paper uses memory-based reinforcement learning, a stochastic gradient descent variant, to train a dialogue agent with a deep reinforcement learner. The simulated scenarios and tasks are",

        "This paper provides a simple method to handle action repetitions. They make the action a tuple (a,x), where a is the action chosen, and x the number of repetitions. Overriding actions allows them to modify the number of repetitions. The method uses a queue and a state machine to represent the action repetitions. The state machine allows them",
