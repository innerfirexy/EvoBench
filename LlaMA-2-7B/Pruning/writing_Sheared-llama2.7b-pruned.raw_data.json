As the pieces of Darkness and Light fused together, the world was born. The world of Creation and Destruction was born from battle. The battle continued on the small sphere and from it came",

I find it rather ironic that I love characters with both qualities (good and bad). I really love Dexter in his most badassy and ruthless ways. I don't like Joss Whedon's 'Frights of the Night' or what it's supposed to be. In my mind there's nothing good in either character.\n[ CW ] I have had the great pleasure of reading and/or watching all the Twilight-related characters. It was fun being immersed into a world.

Death looked across the stars, at the glowing stars visible on their planet and realized that he must go back home to Earth.\nOne of Life's biggest surprises was the beauty and grandeur he received when he arrived on the earth and she has been amazed by his great beauty since then. When their bond was threatened by danger, they turned to one another, who then saved them from life. To this day, Life and Death stand with the best love and are the greatest lovers.\nTo me, I was reminded of The Odyssey as the two characters are similar to each other and look just like how they both appear to be. The bond they have is more like The Odyssey and not as deep as I thought it was going to be. After all, we are the audience of The Odyssey.\n\"Life and Death are",
