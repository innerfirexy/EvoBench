        "This paper describes a new way of variable computation, which uses a different number of units depending on the values of the control parameters. The number N is chosen as variable input and controlled by a formula, and the number L is chosen as variable output, controlled by the formula itself. These units are called \u2018Control Units\u2019, defined by",
        "This paper examines the potential of a \u201cdemocratic choice\u201d to be implemented in Latin America, mainly in Venezuela, but also in other oil-rich countries. The concept of democratic choice is used to investigate the possible reasons for its implementation",
        "This paper proposes the neural noisy channel model, P(x|y), where (x, y) is a input-to-out sequence pair, 0, 1, 2, \u2026 , K values are a data output sequence, and the input sequence is generated through a set of sequential 0-1-K inputs. The noisy channel model is a combination of a regular linear regression model",
        "This paper builds on the work of Weston (2016), using End-to-end memory network analysis to describe the structure of the memory network in early-stage human memory. The paper examines 489 memory networks from one sample of 829 human memory networks. There is high connectivity between memory networks from different age courses. We argue that these memory networks are driven by",
        "This paper extends the GAN framework to allow for latent variables. The observed data set is expanded by drawing latent variables z from a conditional distribution q(z|x). We propose both unified and discrete distributions for the conditional probability of having observed x and z, as well as a new measure of their joint-density. Both are shown to be",
        "This paper introduces a simulator and a set of synthetic tasks for evaluating a dialogue agent's ability to perform a specific conversation task. The tasks were designed to capture the features, such as the agent's confidence, intention, and behavior which are related to how well agents perform conversations. This simulator, the CMOSHawk simulator,",
        "This paper proposes a design principle for computation blocks in convolutional neural networks. In particular, the proposed approach will lead to a lower dimensional model matrix than conventional networks and improve the performances with very high-frequency signals.\nWe consider the problem of solving the discrete-time convolutional neural networks (CNN) with convolution to",
        "This paper studies the energy landscape of the loss function in neural networks.  It is generally believed that the energy is only captured by the back-propagated errors that are propagated from the layers to the errors at the top of the neural network.  We aim to study the connection between the back-propagated errors and the loss function.\nWe",
        "This paper provides a simple method to handle action repetitions. They make the action a tuple (a,x), where a is the action chosen, and x the number of times it has been performed. In this case (a,x) is a tuple (action,count). An action is a tuple (action,num) if there is an action count for each action in the",
        "This paper proposed a proximal (quasi-) Newton\u2019s method to learn binary DNN. The main contribution of this paper is to use it for modeling (i) learning, (ii) optimization and (iii) predicting.\nThis paper proposed a hybrid framework to generate new models using both local and global features. This is an application of a",
        "This paper is a parallel work to Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching. The main solution of both papers is introducing an additional layer to generate the adversarial patterns. It helps the adversaries to see the pattern at different latent states than usual. This layer is denoised using the original"
