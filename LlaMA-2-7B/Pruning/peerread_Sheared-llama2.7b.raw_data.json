Several techniques are presented in a clear way and parameterized method is proposed and evaluated on real image reconstruction tasks.\nAs a result of this work, the authors claim a 3x speedup in the training of",
        "This paper proposes a weakly supervised, end-to-end neural network model for solving a challenging natural language understanding task. \nAs an extension of the Neural Programmer framework \\cite{schwaerzler2018neural}, the paper uses the end-to-end design and pre-trained architectures as well as the end-to-end supervision to tackle such a learning problem. \nUsing data from the large",
        "This paper introduces a 'GPU-friendly' variant of A3C which relaxes some synchronicity constraints in the original A3C algorithm to make it more friendly to a high-performance architecture such as a GPU. The current algorithm uses a novel synchronization mechanism and exploits the hardware-optimized parallelism in the GPU to accelerate computation time drastically. This paper evaluates and",
        "This paper presents an approach to learn to generate programs. Instead of directly trying to generate the program, the authors propose to train a neural net to estimate a fix set of attributes, which then condition the network to generate the program. To better describe these ideas, it is first shown that learning to estimate a set of relevant",
        "This paper considers the problem of model-based policy search. The authors \nconsider the use of Bayesian Neural Networks to learn a model of the environment\nand advocate for the usage of a new approach to optimization known as variable length\nsampling (VLS). Specifically, they use the dynamic environments of the DARPA Robotics Challenge as",
        "This paper describes a new way of variable computation, which uses a different number of units depending on the input. This is different from other methods for variable computation that compute over multiple time steps. The new method offers a more flexible variable computation and a better performance than the methods that use a fixed number of units. Experimental",
        "This paper discussses applying an information bottleneck to deep networks using a variational lower bound and reparameterization trick. The paper is well written and the examples are compelling, but the conclusions are very limited due to the weakness in",
        "This paper proposes the neural noisy channel model, P(x|y), where (x, y) is a input-to-out sequence pair,  based on the authors' knowledge of the physical layer characteristics (which does not, however, take into consideration human perception of the noise). Specifically, P(x|y), is a generalization of the classic conditional (C)DF function, in which each observation",
        "This paper builds on the work of Weston (2016), using End-to-end memory network models for a limited form of dialogue with teacher feedback. As the authors state, the goal of this work is to develop a model of the interactions that occur within dialogues during teaching, learning, and the revision of an existing task.\nThe framework consists of three memory networks,",
        "This paper extends the GAN framework to allow for latent variables. The observed data set is expanded by drawing latent variables z from a conditional distribution q(z|x). The joint distribution of x and z is modeled using the same probability distributions P(x) and P(z). When a condition is met, the algorithm converts it into an integer (the latent",
        "This paper introduces a simulator and a set of synthetic tasks for evaluating a dialogue agent's ability to learn from user feedback. For solving these tasks, the paper uses memory-based methods for dialogue learning in the framework of dialogue synthesis. The proposed method integrates learning from user feedback with the task of enriching",
        "This paper proposes a design principle for computation blocks in convolutional networks based on repeated application of expand and join operations resulting in a fractal-like structure. \n\nThis paper is organized as follows. For the remainder of this paper, $\\bm{\\alpha}$ and $\\bm{\\beta}$ denote random variables in the training phase and they correspond",
        "This paper studies the energy landscape of the loss function in neural networks.  It is generally clearly written and nicely provides intuitions for the results.  One main contribution is to show that the level sets of the loss function  do not intersect between the two different  learning rates $ \\varepsilon_0 \\to 0 $ and ",
        "This paper provides a simple method to handle action repetitions. They make the action a tuple (a,x), where a is the action chosen, and x the number of repetitions. Overall, the method is more accurate than the original implementation.\nImproving the accuracy of a repetition counting algorithm\nThis paper is about improving the accuracy of a method used to count",
        "This paper proposed a proximal (quasi-) Newton\u2019s method to learn binary DNN. The main contribution is to combine pre-conditioning with binarization in a proximal framework, and to show that the resulting algorithm is robust to noise; in particular, it does not require the loss function to be differentiable. Thus, this method does",
        "This paper is a parallel work to Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching. The main solution of both papers is introducing autoencoder into GAN architecture. The main idea is that each network requires to be pretrained prior to input generation (without training the output in each layers). This is one"
