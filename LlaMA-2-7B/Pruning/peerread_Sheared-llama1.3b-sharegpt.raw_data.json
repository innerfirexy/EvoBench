Instead of directly trying to generate the program, the authors propose to train a neural net to estimate a fix set of attributes, which then conditionally detects a given set of attributes. Each set of attributes yields an input for the neural project, which is transformed to a set",
        "This paper considers the problem of model-based policy search. The authors \nconsider the use of Bayesian Neural Networks to learn a model of the environment\nand advocate for use of this model in policy context\nin the context of environmental problems and public policy. In the paper \nthey focus on the potential use of",
        "This paper describes a new way of variable computation, which uses a different number of units depending on the input. This is different from other methods for variable computation that compute over multiple time steps. The variable computations are performed during certain times, and the information is then used to construct a variable using that variable's input.\nThis is an",
        "This paper discussses applying an information bottleneck to deep networks using a variational lower bound and reparameterization trick. The paper is well written and the examples are compelling. The paper discusses applications of a methodical approach with a real-world",
        "This paper proposes the neural noisy channel model, P(x|y), where (x, y) is a input-to-out sequence pair,  based on the authors' hypothesis that it is the most sensitive input at the end of every channel. In this paper, we identify a threshold for a channel that has the lowest input frequency,  and a",
        "This paper builds on the work of Weston (2016), using End-to-end memory network models for a limited form of dialogue with teacher feedback. As the authors state, \u201cDemonstrations show that students engage and develop effective responses to the feedback in a real-life discussion.\nIn order to enhance teachers\u2019 understanding of effective communicating, the paper was reviewed with an expert group of",
        "This paper extends the GAN framework to allow for latent variables. The observed data set is expanded by drawing latent variables z from a conditional distribution q(z|x). The joint distribution q(x|x), q(q|z|x), and q(k|z|q|z|x) are obtained as the joint distribution q(x|x|k|a|x|z|k|z|a|z|a|h|a|h|a|a|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j|j",
        "This paper introduces a simulator and a set of synthetic tasks for evaluating a dialogue agent's ability to learn from user feedback. For solving these tasks, the paper uses memory synthesis, which generates a series of data sets and is then applied against the dialogue agent's memory, using this data to construct an",
        "This paper proposes a design principle for computation blocks in convolutional networks based on repeated application of expand and join operations resulting in a fractal-like structure. \n\nThis paper is a detailed exposition of various applications of convolutional networks while maintaining their practical properties and aesthetics.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Converged Network Design Principles for Conventional Networks}\n\n\\label{Ch15}\n\nConventional",
        "This paper studies the energy landscape of the loss function in neural networks.  It is generally clearly written and nicely provides intuitions for the results.  One main contribution is to show that the level of computational power can improve by providing more computation resources. It aids in determining the dynamics of new systems, thus generating more computing",
        "This paper provides a simple method to handle action repetitions. They make the action a tuple (a,x), where a is the action chosen, and x the number of repetitions. Overlap, this allows repetitions to be repeated, such as 2 x a + 1, and overlacestr = 3.\nThe action is written like this. A_1 = action(1), with a =",
        "This paper proposed a proximal (quasi-) Newton\u2019s method to learn binary DNN. The main contribution is to combine pre-conditioning with binarization in a proximal framework.\nThe learning process of a binary DNN runs a seminar or workshop in which the seminar includes topics on binarization, and the workshop includes binarized content. We propose",
        "This paper is a parallel work to Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching. The main solution of both papers is introducing autoencoder into DF-MSO and the paper explores some of the underlying models we apply here. In both papers, we present algorithmic and non-computational tools for using generative adversarial networks"
