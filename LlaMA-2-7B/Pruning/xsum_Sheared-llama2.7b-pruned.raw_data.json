Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again",

China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with",

What\u2019s not to love?\u201d we asked.\nSo now in the days leading up to the Tour, we all have a sense of excitement to see this season turn into something special which has no doubt been achieved in 2019. We\u2019re also more than content in knowing this is the year, even if you don\u2019t like to admit it, that the real battle for the Tour title will be played.\nIf it weren\u2019t for the WorldTour, there would be no WTCC on top of all these races, so it\u2019s an interesting thing that the first Tour race on the calendar was the one that had the biggest turn-out for the last three years, the 2017-19 Tour Down Under.\nWith three races on the calendar, teams made a conscious",
        "Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, a four-hour training course for police or emergency services staff and an extra exam for those who hold a driving licence. The aim of the consultations is to create a framework which would enable TfL to develop a 12-month course that aims to improve the quality and efficiency of the English language learning programmes in England.\nThe new language and assessment drafts are being developed in consultation with the English Speaking World and the London Borough of Hounslow.\nIt is proposed that those who hold a driving license would need to pass either a four-hour written test or an extra exam to be entitled to access the new English language assessment.

        "Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces were working to reduce gun trafficking, but all eight police forces were found to be having some risk to their operations due to gun-related incidents.\nIt appears, however, that risk to police operations will be a problem not only in the future, but for the foreseeable future if the use of guns for non-violent policing continues to grow.\nAccording to a recent report posted on the White House Blog, 77 percent of the victims of violent crimes in the United States were people who had a firearm in their possession. The number of crimes that result from guns was even more alarming, however. Around one in four violent crimes are recorded with a gun.\nAs a crime-rate number increased (90 percent in the early 19",

        "Aiden Webb, 22, from Norwich, set off to climb the Fansipan mountain alone on 3 June this year. No friends were around. You can imagine how anxious he is to get to the top, to see the views, to get a little selfie with the views, take some photos of yourself and the amazing Fansipan. Of course he needed the help to climb a mountain off the shores of the Pacific, but he did it on his own, using only one hand to hold a rope across the face. The Fansipan ridge contains some of the biggest granite spikes in the world and is regarded as one of the world's best climbing grounds in its own right, but this year the ridge was closed to any climbing. In fact, the mountain is not normally inhospitable: if you are there between September and March, you can usually see at least one",
