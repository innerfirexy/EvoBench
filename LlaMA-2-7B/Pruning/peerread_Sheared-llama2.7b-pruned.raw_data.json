The authors show that a single trained neural net can generate programs out of the fix",
        "This paper considers the problem of model-based policy search. The authors \nconsider the use of Bayesian Neural Networks to learn a model of the environment\nand advocate their use in order to generate models at each node of network.\n\n\n\\begin{proposition}\\label{pr:bsf} If the number of nodes in a network $N$ exceeds\nall powers of $log(N)$, we",
        "This paper describes a new way of variable computation, which uses a different number of units depending on the input. This is different from other methods for variable computation that compute over multiple time steps. The new methods will enable the study of dynamic processes that are able to be studied using the same unit of change. This is",
        "This paper discussses applying an information bottleneck to deep networks using a variational lower bound and reparameterization trick. The paper is well written and the examples are compelling. One minor comment would be the introduction to 1-dimensional applications is",
        "This paper proposes the neural noisy channel model, P(x|y), where (x, y) is a input-to-out sequence pair,  based on the authors' observation of the noisy channel in which a noise vector x=10 and a positive noise 100 are mixed with a noisy signal of magnitude 1. The model is applied to both single and",
        "This paper builds on the work of Weston (2016), using End-to-end memory network models for a limited form of dialogue with teacher feedback. As the authors state, \"The ability to access this kind of personal knowledge is a major advantage to those on the wrong side of the debate, but it is not an advantage to all students of politics,",
        "This paper extends the GAN framework to allow for latent variables. The observed data set is expanded by drawing latent variables z from a conditional distribution q(z|x). The joint distribution and regression models used are simple, with z being the same for all of the observed variables and values in the conditional distribution x. This approach is useful",
        "This paper introduces a simulator and a set of synthetic tasks for evaluating a dialogue agent's ability to learn from user feedback. For solving these tasks, the paper uses memory-aware representations of human behavior.\nScientific Computing International, 1997, vol. 13, no. 2, pp. 229-237.\nThis paper introduces a simulator and a set of synthetic tasks",
        "This paper proposes a design principle for computation blocks in convolutional networks based on repeated application of expand and join operations resulting in a fractal-like structure. \n\nThis paper is the first to demonstrate the fractal-like construction on a convolutional network proposed to be a regular network when the network is performed",
        "This paper studies the energy landscape of the loss function in neural networks.  It is generally clearly written and nicely provides intuitions for the results.  One main contribution is to show that the level of loss in the model can be controlled by a simple parameter (with a range between a negative and positive value) . The",
        "This paper provides a simple method to handle action repetitions. They make the action a tuple (a,x), where a is the action chosen, and x the number of repetitions. Over time, the number of repetitions is multiplied by the number of the action performed. The resulting sequence of numbered actions is then used to store the action sequence",
        "This paper proposed a proximal (quasi-) Newton\u2019s method to learn binary DNN. The main contribution is to combine pre-conditioning with binarization in a proximal framework, which allows the learning of an arbitrarily large number of instances to learn a common model for a very specific class of instances of a class of",
        "This paper is a parallel work to Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching. The main solution of both papers is introducing autoencoder into the two network. In doing so, we introduce a new, low-degree denoising technique, which has the benefit of being simple to implement. In addition, we propose the"
