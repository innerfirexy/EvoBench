        "This paper describes a new way of variable computation, which uses a different number of units depending on the input. This is different from other methods for variable computation that compute over multiple time steps. The new method is called \"relative\" computation and is based on the idea that the value of a quantity depends not on its current",
        "This paper discussses applying an information bottleneck to deep networks using a variational lower bound and reparameterization trick. The paper is well written and the examples are compelling.\nIn this paper, we discuss how to apply an information bottleneck to",
        "This paper proposes the neural noisy channel model, P(x|y), where (x, y) is a input-to-out sequence pair,  based on the authors' observation that the output of a noisy linear amplifier can be represented as a sequence pair (output, error) with a large amount of noise in between. A neural network is then trained on",
        "This paper builds on the work of Weston (2016), using End-to-end memory network models for a limited form of dialogue with teacher feedback. As the authors state, their model is designed to capture the temporal dynamics of face-to-face dialogue between a teacher and a student, but it is possible to extend it to other types of conversational interactions such as",
        "This paper extends the GAN framework to allow for latent variables. The observed data set is expanded by drawing latent variables z from a conditional distribution q(z|x). The joint distribution of x, q, and z is approximated using a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), which transforms the observed data set into a latent space using generative adversarial networks. The",
        "This paper introduces a simulator and a set of synthetic tasks for evaluating a dialogue agent's ability to learn from user feedback. For solving these tasks, the paper uses memory representations such as associative arrays and use them to analyze the dialogue agent's performance and develop new features.\n\nSimulation and Task Evaluation\nOur Simulator is",
        "This paper proposes a design principle for computation blocks in convolutional networks based on repeated application of expand and join operations resulting in a fractal-like structure. \n\nThis paper is structured as follows: We first review the relevant background works on fractal-based design principles and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Next, we propose",
        "This paper studies the energy landscape of the loss function in neural networks.  It is generally clearly written and nicely provides intuitions for the results.  One main contribution is to show that the level-3 energy loss function used in previous works can be improved by incorporating a hierarchical partition of the inputs into the loss function.\n\nThe specific",
        "This paper provides a simple method to handle action repetitions. They make the action a tuple (a,x), where a is the action chosen, and x the number of repetitions. Overall, they provide an efficient way to manage input-output pairs, such as a tuple (9,8) or (1,5). The method is based on the idea of storing intermediate representations (IR)",
        "This paper proposed a proximal (quasi-) Newton\u2019s method to learn binary DNN. The main contribution is to combine pre-conditioning with binarization in a proximal framework to prevent overfitting and undershooting.\nCertainly, for learning binary DNN models, it is crucial to balance the training loss between the binary cross sectional error and the cross-entropy",
        "This paper is a parallel work to Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching. The main solution of both papers is introducing autoencoder into the GAN framework, but in this paper we integrate denoising feature matching to improve the generator quality and reduce the risk of overfitting in GAN. The proposed"
