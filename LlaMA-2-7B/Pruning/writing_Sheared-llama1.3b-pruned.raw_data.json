Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge.

'So many times, when people talk about the ties between food and murder, they just throw out generalities. Well, my experience is, you have to tie it in specific to the case, to the person, to the situation.' Keller's analysis is that the ties between food and murder are often more complex and nuanced than his critics would like to admit, and that his approach to food and murder criticism is justified because it helps to bridge the gap between the two. 'It shows the human experience and how the two are interconnected and that the connection is not just arbitrary,' he said.",
