        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger, the court",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an expert on China's ethnic policy at",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer.

On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties.

It was the Royal couple's first visit to Northern Ireland's best known tourist attraction. The causeway formed when molten rock was forced up through fissures in the earth to form a lava plateau. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh then travelled to the nearby village of Bushmills to commemorate local soldier Robert Quigg. He won a Victoria Cross for bravery during the Battle of the Somme. Sgt Quigg was given the highest military award for valour after going out into the line of fire to search for his commanding officer.

The government said extra funds were being given to early years providers to help children from poorer backgrounds and close the attainment gap. The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London.

Mr Hunt wants to change junior doctors' contracts, which he says are \"unfair\". The BMA said its door was open to talks and blamed the strikes on Mr Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling\" of the matter. The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT.

It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene.

At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said.

The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the funding is from the European Union. The technology being developed aims to enable homes, offices, shops and factories to generate, store and use their own solar energy. It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass on buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing solar air collectors or steel \"skins\" which create cavities between the heated metal and the building to harness and store solar heat. They hope to create buildings which will not need a gas supply. One industrial unit in Port Talbot has already been generating all its own heat through solar power for the last three years. Kevin Bygate, chief executive of Specific said the potential was to deliver a \"game changer\" on energy:",

The incident occurred on the A38 near Plymouth last Tuesday evening.  Witnesses reported heavy rain and reduced visibility at the time.  Scott, a serving officer in the Royal Marines, pleaded not guilty to charges of causing death by dangerous driving at Plymouth Crown Court today.  His defense team argued that while speed may have been a contributing factor, the unpredictable weather conditions played a significant role in the accident.  The prosecution, however, presented evidence suggesting Scott's speed was excessive and reckless, even for favorable conditions.  The trial is expected to last for five days, with further witness testimonies and expert analysis of vehicle data scheduled.

The ban specifically targets the wearing of niqabs and other veils in public spaces, citing concerns about \"social stability\" and \"national security.\"  While officials claim the restrictions are for security purposes, critics argue they represent a further tightening of control over the predominantly Uyghur Muslim population.  Human rights groups have long condemned the Chinese government's policies in Xinjiang, alleging widespread human rights abuses, including mass detention and forced assimilation.  The ban has been met with mixed reactions, with some residents expressing support while others fear further erosion of religious freedoms.

The report is being launched by the think tank today and reveals stark regional inequalities in child outcomes.  Despite facing significant disadvantages, children in the capital's most deprived areas achieved better results in key areas like reading, writing, and maths compared to their counterparts in northern England.  The IPPR attributes this disparity to a number of factors, including higher levels of investment in London's education system, greater access to resources and extracurricular activities, and a potentially more robust social safety net.  However, the report also highlights the concerningly low overall performance of children from deprived backgrounds across the UK, urging the government to address the systemic inequalities that continue to disadvantage children regardless of location.

        "The A320 pilot reported seeing a white quadcopter drone \"flash past\" the aircraft while travelling south of Brookmans Park last August. No collision occurred, but the near-miss prompted an investigation by the UK Airprox Board, which classified the incident as a serious risk.  The drone's proximity to the airliner, at an altitude of 3,000 feet, raised concerns about the potential for catastrophic consequences.  The pilot described the drone as moving at a considerable speed.\n\nWhile the identity of the drone operator remains unknown, the incident highlights the growing dangers posed by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to commercial air travel.  The Airprox Board's report emphasizes the need for increased awareness and stricter adherence to drone safety regulations.  Failure to comply with airspace restrictions puts both aircraft and individuals on the ground at serious risk. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities urging anyone with information to come forward.\n",
        "A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than four weeks.  The findings, released by the Center for Work-Life Policy, highlight a significant gap between available leave and actual usage among new fathers.  While many companies offer generous paternity leave policies, societal expectations and workplace pressures appear to be deterrents.  The survey, which polled over 500 individuals, also revealed a correlation between company culture and leave uptake.  Companies with strong support for parental leave and flexible work arrangements saw significantly higher rates of paternity leave usage.  Experts suggest that increased awareness, supportive workplace policies, and a cultural shift towards valuing parental involvement are crucial to bridging this gap and promoting better work-life balance for new fathers.  The economic impact of fathers not taking leave, such as potential strain on mothers and reduced family income, was also flagged as a concern.\n",

This decision, announced by the Parades Commission yesterday, continues to spark controversy.  The Commission cited concerns about public safety and potential sectarian tensions as the reason for restricting the parade route.  Representatives from the Orange Order expressed their disappointment, arguing the restrictions are discriminatory and unfairly limit their right to peaceful assembly.  However, local residents and community groups welcomed the decision, highlighting past incidents of anti-Catholic chanting and intimidation near the church.  The PSNI will have a significant presence to monitor the parade and ensure the restrictions are adhered to.  The decision underscores the ongoing sensitivities surrounding parades in Northern Ireland and the delicate balance required to manage competing interests.

The 24-year-old's death was treated as accidental, but lingering questions and inconsistencies surrounding the case have led to a renewed investigation.  His family, who have long suspected foul play, have tirelessly campaigned for a re-examination of the evidence.  Initial reports suggested drowning, but inconsistencies in witness testimonies and a lack of thorough forensic analysis at the time have fueled speculation of a potential cover-up.\n\nNew evidence, including recently surfaced witness statements and advanced forensic techniques unavailable in 1997, has prompted the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service to reopen the case.  A dedicated team of detectives is now reviewing all available material, aiming to provide closure to the McLeod family and definitively determine the circumstances surrounding Kevin's death.

        "Mr Joshua told his congregation on Sunday that he \"saw\" a woman winning. After Donald Trump convincingly won Tuesday's vote, visitors to the controversial Nigerian televangelist's website have been quick to express their disappointment and question his prophetic abilities.  Many online comments highlighted the perceived inaccuracy of his prediction, leading to a renewed debate surrounding the reliability of religious prophecies in political contexts.  Some defended Mr. Joshua, citing the complexities of divine revelation, while others called for greater accountability from religious leaders making public pronouncements about future events.  The incident underscores the ongoing tension between faith, political predictions, and the often-uncertain nature of interpreting spiritual guidance.

        "Entrants to the annual event have five minutes to tell the biggest and most convincing lie they can. Winner George Kemp from Maryport, Cumbria,  secured victory with his elaborate tale of accidentally launching a weather balloon carrying a miniature replica of Buckingham Palace into the stratosphere.  Judges were particularly impressed by Kemp's detailed account of the balloon's trajectory, its near-miss with a flock of migrating geese, and the subsequent recovery of the palace model, slightly singed but otherwise intact, from a farmer's field in the Scottish Highlands.  Kemp, a retired plumber, beat out stiff competition, including a convincing yarn about a pet squirrel who could knit and a seemingly plausible explanation for the disappearance of the Loch Ness Monster (it moved to the Canary Islands, apparently).  The annual \"Great British Lie-Off\" attracted hundreds of entrants, all vying for the coveted Golden Pinocchio award and the \u00a3500 prize money.  Kemp plans to spend his winnings on",
        "Mark Footitt took 3-52 as the visitors lost five wickets before lunch while Sam Curran dismissed England opener Haseeb Hameed for a duck, leaving the hosts in a commanding position on day one of the County Championship match.  Footitt, exploiting the overcast conditions, ripped through the top order, his accurate swing bowling proving too much for the tourists' batsmen.  Hameed's early dismissal set the tone, with a combination of sharp bowling and some questionable shot selection contributing to the collapse.  The wickets tumbled steadily, leaving the visitors reeling at a precarious 112-5 at the lunch interval.  While a few batsmen showed glimpses of resistance, Footitt's consistent threat and the accuracy of the other bowlers proved too difficult to overcome.  The afternoon session promises to be crucial as the visitors attempt to rebuild their innings and avoid a significant first-innings deficit.\n",

        "The company behind the abattoir in Haverfordwest, Emcol 2008 Ltd, collapsed in January 2016 with debts of \u00a3660,000.  The closure left a significant void in the local economy, impacting not only the 80 employees who lost their jobs but also farmers and suppliers who relied on the facility.  The subsequent auction of the abattoir's assets yielded significantly less than anticipated, leaving creditors with minimal recovery prospects.  Investigations into the company's downfall revealed struggles with profitability and increasing competition within the meat processing sector.  The impact extended beyond immediate financial losses; the closure disrupted the local supply chain, forcing farmers to seek alternative processing options, often further afield, leading to increased transportation costs and reduced market access.

Her partner, Ian Stewart, was subsequently arrested and charged with her murder.  The trial revealed a chilling picture of Stewart's manipulative and controlling behaviour towards Bailey, including financial abuse and the gradual isolation of the author from her friends and family.

The staggering figure represents the economic cost of fossil fuel subsidies globally, highlighting the immense financial burden these policies place on taxpayers and the environment.  The report details how these subsidies, often hidden within energy bills or tax breaks, actively hinder the transition to cleaner energy sources.  This financial support for a polluting industry not only exacerbates climate change but also diverts resources that could be invested in renewable energy infrastructure and green technology.  The researchers urge governments to phase out these subsidies, freeing up substantial funds for crucial investments in a sustainable future.

        "The care at Stafford Hospital left some patients drinking water from vases, it is claimed, and receptionists assessing emergency cases. Julie Bailey, who founded the Cure the NHS campaign after her mother's death at the hospital, detailed harrowing accounts of neglect in a recent interview.  She described a system overwhelmed by understaffing and a lack of basic hygiene, painting a picture of widespread suffering.  Patients, she alleged, were left unattended for extended periods, forced to rely on makeshift solutions for hydration due to a shortage of drinking water.  The claim that receptionists were making triage decisions, typically the responsibility of trained medical professionals, raises serious questions about patient safety.  Bailey's testimony underscores the long-lasting impact of the scandal, highlighting the need for ongoing reform and robust oversight within the NHS to prevent similar tragedies from recurring.  The revelations serve as a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of systemic failures in healthcare.\n",

Dominic Scott, head of the UK Council for International Student Affairs, said it would \"significantly impact\" the number of international students choosing the UK.  The government is reportedly considering raising the minimum English language proficiency score required for student visas, potentially affecting applications across all academic levels.  This move comes amidst concerns about the quality of English spoken by some international students and a broader government focus on immigration control.\n\nCritics argue the stricter requirements could damage the UK's reputation as a leading global education hub, deterring high-achieving students and impacting the significant economic contribution international students make. Universities are already expressing anxieties about the potential loss of revenue and the difficulty in recruiting a diverse student body.  The proposals are expected to face intense scrutiny from educational institutions and advocacy groups before any final decisions are made.\n",

The images show a lioness, seemingly unconcerned by the cub's different appearance, attentively cleaning and nursing a young spotted hyena.  Experts are baffled by the unusual sight, suggesting several possible explanations.  The hyena cub may have been orphaned or abandoned, leading the lioness to instinctively care for the vulnerable creature.  Another theory points to the lioness\u2019s own recent cub loss, triggering maternal instincts towards any young animal in need.
