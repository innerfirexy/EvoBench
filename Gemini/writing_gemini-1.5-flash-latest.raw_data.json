Their mother had died last week in a territory battle. We don't get those much in the reserve because of the large space and abundant resources, but it still happens. This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest.

Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle. Breaking the seal on the letter, I unrolled it, reading the letter. *Dear Hanna, If you are reading this, then I have failed. We are cursed, and soon it will pass to you.

The faded sun rose through the horizon in the smog filled skies of Rome. I trudged through beggars and merchants on my way to another hard day at the docks. The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The long walk to work provided ample time to daydream about warm meals and deep sleep, luxuries of a distant past. But I didn't have time to daydream today. I couldn't afford to be late. Again. As I neared the docks, my eyes were drawn to a nearby newsstand. A graphic image of a red skinned warrior being gunned down by legionnaires was depicted before me. **TRIUMPH IN THE",

Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds",

Lily, all of seven years old, speaks of bruises that \"Mommy\" inflicts, of a father who yells and slams doors, and a constant gnawing hunger.  The luxury apartment you envisioned her escaping from is replaced in your mind with a cramped, neglected flat, filled with the echoes of shouting and the scent of stale cigarette smoke.

TIFU by breathing fire Okay, so, \"TIFU by breathing fire.\"  The most obvious interpretation is a spectacularly failed attempt at a fire-breathing performance. Perhaps a poorly-mixed flammable concoction resulted in a facial inferno, singed eyebrows, or even a trip to the burn unit.  Alternatively, the \"fire\" could be metaphorical.  Maybe the OP unleashed a torrent of angry words, a fiery tirade, onto someone important \u2013 a boss, a significant other, a judge. The resulting \"fire\" might be the metaphorical flames of wrath and the ensuing fallout.  Or, perhaps the most mundane explanation: they accidentally set something on fire while attempting to breathe fire (their toast, their hair, a nearby curtain).  Either way, it promises a hilariously disastrous story.\n",

For Elara, it was the chipped teacup, a relic from her grandmother's attic, whispering tales of forgotten summers and lavender-scented linens.  The chipped rim mirrored the cracks in her own life, a life suddenly devoid of purpose after her grandmother's passing.  The teacup, however, held a secret \u2013 a tiny, faded inscription hinting at a hidden garden, a place where time flowed differently, a place where perhaps, she could begin again.  The journey wouldn't be easy; a cryptic map, a grumpy badger, and a suspiciously helpful gnome were just some of the initial challenges.

The wilting plant, a rare specimen named \"Gloombringer,\" emits a previously unknown pollen, highly allergenic to a key negotiator in upcoming peace talks.  His violent sneezing fit disrupts the delicate diplomacy, causing the walkout of a key player.  News outlets sensationalize the incident, fueling public outrage and mistrust.  Rival nations, already on edge, interpret the diplomatic failure as an act of aggression.  Misunderstandings escalate, fueled by social media's rapid spread of misinformation.
