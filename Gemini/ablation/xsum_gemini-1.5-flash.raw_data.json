Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer.

On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head.

The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London. Its survey also found five northern city-regions combined had almost as many well-qualified individuals (3.6 million) as London (3.7 million) - but the IPPR forecasts demand for skilled workers in the North is set to increase.

Mr Hunt wants to change junior doctors' contracts, which he says are \"unfair\". The BMA said its door was open to talks and blamed the strikes on Mr Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling\" of the matter. The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT.

But Clark's 108 not out from 133 balls and Shivnarine Chanderpaul's steady 85 not out rebuilt the visitor's innings. Clark reached his century with a huge pulled six shortly before the close. Retired West Indies international Chanderpaul put on 55 with Ryan McLaren, calming the innings after the early wickets, before the 42-year-old was joined by Clark when Gareth Batty dismissed McLaren.

It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass on buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing solar air collectors or steel \"skins\" which create cavities between the heated metal and the building to harness and store solar heat. They hope to create buildings which will not need a gas supply. One industrial unit in Port Talbot has already been generating all its own heat through solar power for the last three years. Kevin Bygate, chief executive of Specific said the potential was to deliver a \"game changer\" on energy: not only for buildings to become self-sufficient but",

The report is being launched by the think tank today and highlights stark regional inequalities in child outcomes.  Despite facing significant disadvantage, children in the capital's most deprived areas achieved better results in key areas like reading, writing, and maths than their counterparts in the north of England.  The IPPR attributes this disparity to a number of factors, including higher levels of investment in education and social services in London, alongside greater access to resources and opportunities.  However, the report also notes that even in London, significant challenges remain, with persistent poverty impacting educational attainment.  The research calls for targeted investment in deprived northern communities to level the playing field and ensure all children have the chance to succeed, regardless of their postcode.

        "A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than four weeks.  The findings, published today by the Institute for Family Studies, highlight a significant disparity between available leave and actual usage, particularly among men.  Researchers attribute this low uptake to a variety of factors, including workplace culture, financial pressures, and a lack of awareness regarding available benefits.  Many respondents reported feeling pressured to return to work quickly, fearing negative impacts on their careers.  The study underscores a growing concern about the unequal distribution of parental responsibilities, with mothers overwhelmingly bearing the brunt of childcare.  The researchers call for greater employer support, including guaranteed paid leave and flexible working arrangements, to encourage more fathers to take advantage of paternity leave and promote a more equitable work-life balance.  The long-term impact on both fathers and children of this limited parental involvement warrants further investigation.\n",

        "On 30 January 1915, England played Scotland in a charity match organised by former England international and Northampton Saints captain Edgar Mobbs. The aim of the game, played at Queen's Club, was to raise funds for the families of professional rugby players serving in the armed forces during the First World War.  The match, a thrilling encounter, saw England emerge victorious, though the score is lost to history.  More significant than the result was the demonstration of unity and support for those fighting overseas.  The event highlighted the profound impact of the war on sporting life and the dedication of the rugby community to supporting their comrades. Mobbs himself, a decorated soldier, tragically lost his life in the Battle of the Somme later that year, making the match a poignant memory of a time when even the fiercest sporting rivalries were overshadowed by a shared national crisis.

The initiative focuses on integrating renewable energy generation directly into building designs, transforming structures into self-sufficient energy hubs.  This involves utilizing a range of technologies, including solar panels, wind turbines, and potentially even hydrogen fuel cells, depending on the building's location and purpose.\n\nThe goal is to significantly reduce reliance on the national grid, lowering carbon emissions and creating more sustainable communities.  Early prototypes are already underway, with plans to test the integrated systems in various building types, from residential homes to industrial facilities. Successful implementation could not only significantly impact energy costs for building owners but also contribute to the UK's overall decarbonization targets.  The project\u2019s success hinges on efficient energy storage and smart grid integration, areas where the partners are investing considerable research and development.\n",

        "The care at Stafford Hospital left some patients drinking water from vases, it is claimed, and receptionists assessing emergency cases. Julie Bailey, who founded the Cure the NHS campaign after her mother's death at the hospital, has spoken of the shocking conditions she witnessed.  Her testimony, part of a wider inquiry into the failings at Stafford Hospital, paints a grim picture of neglect and inadequate staffing.  Patients, according to Bailey, were left dehydrated and forced to drink from vases due to a lack of readily available drinking water.  Furthermore, untrained receptionists were allegedly tasked with triaging emergency patients, a responsibility far beyond their capabilities.  The revelations highlight systemic failures within the hospital, raising serious questions about patient safety and accountability.  The inquiry is expected to delve deeper into these allegations and determine the extent of the negligence and its consequences.  The full report is anticipated to be a damning indictment of the hospital\u2019s management and practices.\n",

        "The Financial Conduct Authority said these customers were profitable for card providers and so there were few incentives for the firms to intervene. It said customers should be better protected from unaffordable credit.  The FCA's report highlights the concerning lack of intervention by credit card companies regarding customers trapped in cycles of persistent debt.  Profitability, it argues, overshadowed responsible lending practices, leading to a situation where vulnerable individuals faced escalating debt without sufficient support or intervention from providers.  This failure to act, the FCA stated, resulted in significant financial hardship for numerous customers.  The report recommends stricter regulations and increased oversight to ensure card providers proactively identify and assist struggling customers, rather than solely focusing on maximizing profits from their debt.  The FCA is calling for a shift in industry culture, emphasizing ethical lending practices over short-term financial gains.\n",
