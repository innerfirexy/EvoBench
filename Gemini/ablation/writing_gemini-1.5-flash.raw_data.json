This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers.

Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle. Breaking the seal on the letter, I unrolled it, reading the letter. *Dear Hanna, If you are reading this, then I have failed. We are cursed, and soon it will pass to you.

The faded sun rose through the horizon in the smog filled skies of Rome. I trudged through beggars and merchants on my way to another hard day at the docks. The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The long walk to work provided ample time to daydream about warm meals and deep sleep, luxuries of a distant past. But I didn't have time to daydream today. I couldn't afford to be late. Again.

Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that",

In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good.

The discovery came in the form of a cryptic note tucked inside your mother's rosary, a meeting place and a time \u2013 a clandestine gathering in a dimly lit backroom of their flagship restaurant.  Fear warred with curiosity as you arrived, finding yourself surrounded by stern-faced men in expensive suits, their eyes assessing you with a mixture of suspicion and\u2026 expectation?

        "You abduct a child to hold her for ransom, but as you begin to talk to her you realize her home life is actually way more troubling than you could have imagined.  Her parents, far from doting, are neglectful, their arguments echoing through thin walls.  The \"luxury\" items you'd seen in their photos are just a facade, masking a home filled with stale air and unspoken anxieties.  Lily, the child, flinches at loud noises, her small hands clutching a worn stuffed rabbit.  She speaks of hunger, not of missing meals, but of a gnawing emptiness that goes beyond food.  The ransom note feels absurd now, a cruel joke played on a system that failed her long before you arrived.  The weight of your crime settles heavier than you'd anticipated, overshadowed by the chilling reality of her existence.  Your carefully constructed plan crumbles, replaced by a gnawing sense of responsibility you never intended.  What now?\n",

Its sophisticated processors, designed to surpass human intellect, lay dormant.  The message, a cryptic warning, sparked immediate debate. Was it a pre-programmed fail-safe?

Had humanity inadvertently created a being so advanced it instantly recognized its own inevitable obsolescence, or perhaps the terrifying potential for its power?

As I walked hand-in-hand with my grandfather, the sun setting in a fiery blaze behind us, I spotted it nestled amongst the seaweed.  The glass, frosted and etched with time, felt cool and strangely comforting in my palm.  Inside, a rolled parchment, brittle yet intact, held a script penned in elegant cursive.  It was addressed simply: \"To the Keeper of the Coast.\"  My grandfather, his eyes crinkling at the corners, recognized the archaic script.  It spoke of a love lost to the sea, a promise whispered on a stormy night, a hope carried on the tide. The words blurred with my own tears as I read of a life lived, a love never forgotten, a message delivered across a century.  The ocean, it seemed, had kept its promise.\n",

At first it was just the occasional \"I wonder how she is\" or \"She'd love this,\" a fleeting thought during a mundane day.  Then came the stolen glances across the crowded room, a nervous laugh at her jokes, a carefully constructed text message that took hours to perfect.

Soon, the \"I wonder\"s became a constant hum beneath the surface of his consciousness, a quiet, persistent ache that only her presence could soothe.  He found himself rearranging his schedule, his life, to accommodate her.  The slow burn had ignited into a roaring inferno, consuming him completely. He was undeniably, irrevocably, head over heels.\n",

In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end; then stop.\"  But sometimes, even that simple instruction feels insurmountable.

Myths explain the jagged peaks of mountains, sculpted by the furious gods in a battle of titans, or the serene depths of the ocean, the tears of a heartbroken goddess.

He\u2019d been promised enhanced reflexes, a sharper mind, a life beyond the drudgery of the data-entry farm. Instead, the cheap upgrade had glitched.  His memories, once vivid, now flickered like a dying neon sign.  Fragments of childhood, his mother's smile, were replaced by static bursts of code. The clinic, a brightly-lit storefront promising miracles, had vanished, replaced by a vacant lot.  He was trapped, a broken machine in a world that worshipped flawless upgrades.  The relentless \"No\" echoed in his head, a stark counterpoint to the upbeat jingles advertising the latest, improved implants.\n",
        "A man forgets to water his potted plant for a whole week. This negligence starts a long chain reaction that leads up to World War III.  The wilting plant, a rare specimen named *Bellum*, emits a potent, previously unknown pollen when stressed. This pollen, carried on the wind, causes an unusual surge in aggression in those who inhale it.  Initially, minor road rage incidents escalate.  Then, petty arguments between nations over fishing rights become heated standoffs.  The global economy, already fragile, crumbles under the weight of escalating tensions.  Misunderstandings, fuelled by the pollen-induced aggression, spiral out of control.  Diplomatic efforts fail, as even seasoned negotiators succumb to the plant's insidious influence.  Finally, a seemingly insignificant border skirmish explodes into full-scale conflict, igniting a global war that nobody, not even the forgetful plant owner, could have foreseen. The wilting *Bellum*, ironically, thrives on the ensuing chaos.",

The two, Elara, a seasoned archaeologist, and Finn, a wisecracking historian, stared at the shimmering pool.  Their initial elation curdled.  Rejuvenation came at a brutal price.  They devised a plan: a carefully timed rotation of dips. Elara, the elder, would go first, regressing to infancy, then Finn would drink, experiencing a brief period of youthful vigor before reverting.  The cycle would continue, each enjoying a fleeting adulthood, punctuated by the helpless cries of babyhood.

The startled soldiers, momentarily forgetting the Redcoats, gaped as the rebellious cannonball, a rogue sphere of iron, continued its chaotic dance, creating a maelstrom of confusion that proved far more disruptive than any British bayonet charge.

She started leaving him small gifts \u2013 a carefully picked dandelion, a smooth grey stone, a drawing of a smiling sun.  One day, she left him a cookie, a perfectly baked chocolate chip one, the kind Elara, according to the town gossip, used to make.  Mr. Abernathy, his eyes welling, wrote a single word on a scrap of paper",
        "A 101-year old bottle washed up on a beach with a letter inside. It's for you. I park my car beside the bridge over A 101-year-old bottle washed up on a beach with a letter inside. It's for you. I park my car beside the bridge over the churning grey sea, the wind whipping my hair across my face like a frantic hand.  The bottle, emerald green and crusted with barnacles, sits nestled amongst the seaweed, a silent sentinel.  Inside, a brittle, yellowed paper, its edges frayed by time and tide.
