        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their",

The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT.

The findings, part of a wider inspection into police effectiveness, highlighted concerns over the force's ability to respond to emergencies and investigate crimes effectively.\n\nThe report praised some aspects of the force's performance, particularly its efforts to tackle organized crime. However, inspectors found that staff shortages were impacting on officer well-being and leading to a reliance on overtime. This, they warned, could negatively affect the quality of service provided to the public.\n\nThe HMIC has urged the force to develop a comprehensive workforce plan to address the staffing crisis. This includes improving recruitment processes, exploring new ways to attract and retain officers, and ensuring that staff have the necessary resources and support to carry out their duties effectively.

        "The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) said London's poorest children outperformed those in the north. The report is being launched by the think tank today, highlighting a stark educational divide across England. While disadvantaged pupils in the capital have seen significant improvements in recent decades, their counterparts in the North lag behind.\n\nThe IPPR attributes this disparity to a combination of factors, including sustained investment in London's schools and a more diverse teacher workforce. However, they argue that the \"London effect\" is not a magic bullet and that similar success can be replicated elsewhere.\n\nThe report calls for a renewed focus on tackling regional inequalities in education, urging the government to prioritize investment in northern schools and implement targeted interventions to support disadvantaged pupils. They emphasize the need for a long-term strategy that addresses the root causes of the attainment gap, ensuring all children have equal opportunities, regardless of their location or background.\n",

The Northampton Saints winger was left unconscious for several minutes following the incident, which occurred in the 17th minute of the match. Thompstone received a yellow card for the tackle, while North was stretchered off the field and taken to hospital.\n\nInitial scans came back all clear, but the incident has raised fresh concerns about the safety of the sport. North has a history of concussions, having suffered four head injuries in five months between November 2014 and March 2015.

        "Seamer Abbott, 29, and top-order batsman Rossouw, 27, confirmed their international retirements in January. The South African duo had signed lucrative Kolpak deals with Hampshire, effectively ending their Proteas careers. This sent shockwaves through South African cricket, highlighting the growing issue of player drain to English county cricket.\n\nKolpak deals, named after a Slovak handball player, allowed cricketers from countries with trade agreements with the European Union to play in England without being considered overseas players. This made them highly attractive to counties seeking quality players without impacting their overseas player quota.\n\nThe loss of Abbott and Rossouw was a significant blow to South Africa. Both were established internationals, and their departure raised concerns about the future of the national team. Brexit, however, brought an end to the Kolpak era in 2020, stemming the flow of South African talent to England, at least temporarily.\n",

He claimed the government had made a \"fair and reasonable\" offer, reflecting the vital role junior doctors play in the National Health Service (NHS).\n\nThe BMA, however, strongly refuted these claims, arguing that the government's offer did not address the core issues of pay erosion and unsafe working conditions. They maintain that the strikes are a last resort, necessary to protect the future of the NHS and ensure patient safety. The ongoing dispute has resulted in significant disruption to healthcare services, with thousands of appointments and operations postponed.

As the South Korean company struggled to address reports of its Galaxy Note 7 catching fire, it initially offered replacements. However, when the replacement devices also exhibited the same dangerous defect, the company was forced to make the unprecedented decision to discontinue the model entirely.\n\nThe global recall and subsequent discontinuation of the Note 7 have sent shockwaves through the industry, leaving consumers questioning the safety of the devices they carry every day. Analysts estimate the debacle could cost the company billions of dollars in lost sales and brand damage. The company faces a steep uphill battle to regain consumer trust and salvage its reputation.

This payment was intended to support disadvantaged students, but Dr Farry has stated that it has not been effective in achieving its goals. The removal of the funding has been met with criticism from college principals and student representatives, who argue that it will have a negative impact on some of the most vulnerable learners.\n\nDr Farry has defended his decision, saying that the money will be reallocated to other areas of further education, such as apprenticeships and skills training. He has also said that he is committed to supporting disadvantaged students, and that his department will continue to work with colleges to ensure that they have the resources they need.

        "The H3 project combines back office services at four police, fire and council authorities in Hampshire and Oxfordshire, to save up to \u00a35m a year. The collaboration between Hampshire County Council, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Service, and Oxfordshire County Council, aims to streamline operations and reduce costs through shared services.\n\nThe project focuses on merging human resources, finance, and procurement functions. By consolidating these services, the authorities expect to eliminate duplication, improve efficiency, and achieve significant financial savings. The initiative has been met with mixed reactions. Supporters believe it represents a sensible approach to public sector cost-cutting, while critics express concerns about potential job losses and the impact on service quality. The success of the H3 project will likely influence similar collaborations across the UK as public sector organizations seek innovative ways to manage budgetary constraints.\n",
        "The proposals are believed to include tougher English language requirements for students. Dominic Scott, head of the UK Council for International Student Affairs, said it would be a \"great shame\" if the UK were to lose its status as a top destination for international students.\n\nThe government has been considering changes to the student visa system for some time, in a bid to reduce net migration. One of the key proposals is to raise the minimum English language requirement for students. This would mean that students would need to demonstrate a higher level of English proficiency in order to be granted a visa.\n\nThe proposals have been met with criticism from universities and student groups, who argue that they would damage the UK's reputation as a world-leading destination for higher education. They also warn that the changes could lead to a significant drop in the number of international students coming to the UK, which would have a negative impact on the economy.\n",
        "The Financial Conduct Authority said these customers were profitable for card providers and so there were few incentives for the firms to intervene. It said customers should be contacted by credit card firms if they have been making only minimum repayments for 18 months.\n\nThe financial watchdog is tightening the rules around persistent debt, aiming to protect vulnerable consumers trapped in a cycle of minimum payments. New regulations will require firms to proactively encourage customers to increase repayments where possible, and to consider suspending cards after 36 months of persistent debt.\n\nThis intervention follows concerns that thousands of borrowers are accruing significant interest charges, with little progress made in clearing their balances. The FCA believes this proactive approach will help individuals regain control of their finances and avoid long-term debt burdens. Critics, however, worry the move could restrict access to credit for those who rely on it most.\n",
        "Meanwhile, Burundian police said they had arrested two foreign journalists who were reporting on armed groups. Violence in the country began last April, when President Pierre Nkurunziza announced his intention to run for a third term, a move many considered unconstitutional.\n\nThe journalists, Jean-Philippe Remy, Africa bureau chief for French newspaper *Le Monde*, and British photojournalist Phil Moore, were detained along with several others during a raid in the capital, Bujumbura.\n\nBurundian authorities accused the journalists of supporting the opposition and claimed to have seized weapons and communication equipment. However, international organizations, including the Committee to Protect Journalists, have condemned the arrests, calling them an attack on press freedom.\n\nThe arrests highlight the escalating tensions in Burundi, where hundreds have died and thousands have fled the country amidst political unrest. The international community continues to pressure the Burundian government to engage in dialogue and resolve the crisis peacefully.\n",
        "Ben Butler met a psychologist in 2004 after assaulting a man in a nightclub. Dr Tim Green wrote Mr Butler found it \"difficult to control his anger,\" according to court documents. The documents revealed a history of violent behavior, including an incident where Butler reportedly threatened to kill his partner and their unborn child.\n\nDespite these concerns, Butler was later granted custody of his daughter, Ellie. In 2013, Ellie tragically died, and Butler was subsequently convicted of her murder. The case sparked outrage and led to a serious case review, which criticized social services for failing to adequately protect Ellie.\n\nThe review highlighted Dr. Green's assessment as a crucial piece of evidence that was seemingly overlooked. Critics argue that had the psychologist's warnings been heeded, Ellie's death might have been prevented. The case continues to raise questions about the effectiveness of child protection services and the weight given to expert psychological evaluations in custody battles.\n",

And the Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office, Larry the cat, shows no signs of retiring from his prestigious post.\n\nDespite witnessing the tenures of four different Prime Ministers - David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson, and now Rishi Sunak - Larry has remained a constant presence, navigating the political landscape with dignified indifference. He's been involved in a few scuffles, notably with Palmerston, the former Foreign Office cat, but mostly spends his days patrolling his territory, napping in sunbeams, and occasionally accepting treats from adoring fans.\n\nWhile his official duties include keeping Downing Street rodent-free, Larry's impact extends beyond pest control.

        "The fragile piece of wood is all that remains of the Nanteos Cup, a wooden chalice named after the mansion in Wales where it was kept for centuries. Once believed to be the Holy Grail, the vessel attracted pilgrims seeking its supposed healing powers.\n\nLegend held that the cup was brought to Britain by Joseph of Arimathea after the crucifixion of Jesus. It resided in Glastonbury Abbey until the Dissolution of the Monasteries, after which seven monks fled with it to Strata Florida Abbey, then eventually to Nanteos Mansion.\n\nThe cup's reputation for healing drew visitors from far and wide, many of whom would nibble pieces off the rim, hoping to benefit from its power. This practice, combined with the cup's age, led to its eventual disintegration. Only a small fragment of the once revered object now remains, kept at the National Library of Wales.\n",
        "Charles Mumbere, the king of Rwenzururu, is entitled to these privileges because he suffers from hypertension and diabetes, it added. The Ugandan High Court recently granted the traditional leader modified bail conditions, allowing him to travel abroad for specialized medical treatment. Mumbere, who faces a slew of charges including terrorism and murder linked to deadly clashes in 2016, has been restricted from visiting his kingdom in western Uganda since his arrest.\n\nThe court's decision comes after Mumbere's legal team presented evidence of his deteriorating health. They argued that his conditions require specialized care not readily available within Uganda. While the specific destination for his treatment was not disclosed, the court's ruling represents a significant, albeit temporary, easing of the restrictions placed upon the embattled king. The prosecution did not object to the application, paving the way for Mumbere to seek the medical attention he reportedly needs.\n",
        "These beautiful pictures are the first ever taken of a wild lioness nursing a cub from a different species - an extremely rare event. The pair were spotted in Tanzania's Ngorongoro Conservation Area, where a five-year-old lioness, known as Nosikitok, was seen caring for a weeks-old leopard cub.\n\nConservationists are baffled by this unusual interspecies adoption. While captive big cats have been known to nurse other species, this is the first documented case in the wild. Experts believe Nosikitok, who recently had her own cubs, may have experienced a surge in maternal hormones, leading her to accept the leopard cub.\n\nThe cub's fate remains uncertain. The likelihood of survival is slim, as the leopard cub will eventually need to learn species-specific hunting skills. However, the heartwarming images have captured global attention, showcasing a unique and touching example of cross-species compassion in the wild.\n",

The ride, which simulates white-water rafting, was immediately closed following the incident.\n\nEmergency services, including an air ambulance, were dispatched to the scene, and Evha was rushed to Birmingham Children's Hospital. Despite the best efforts of medical professionals, she succumbed to her injuries shortly after arrival.\n\nThe Jameah Girls Academy pupil was described as a \"beautiful little girl who was full of love and always smiling.\" Her family has been left devastated by the loss, and the school community is in mourning.\n\nThe Health and Safety Executive has launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident. Drayton Manor remained closed on Wednesday as a mark of respect. The tragedy has sparked a debate about safety standards at theme parks.\n",
        "The holders, who also won the trophy in 2013, bowed out in the group stage despite six wins in 14 games. Promotion in the County Championship remains the priority for Durham, but their early exit from the One-Day Cup will be a bitter pill to swallow. A strong start to the season had fans dreaming of another successful campaign, but a string of losses in the latter half of the tournament proved fatal.\n\nLancashire and Warwickshire secured the top two spots in Group A, progressing to the knockout stages. Durham's batting, often reliant on a few key players, lacked consistency, while the bowling attack struggled to contain opposing teams in crucial moments. Head Coach Ryan Campbell will undoubtedly analyze the campaign closely, looking to address these weaknesses before next season. The team will now turn its full attention to securing a return to Division One of the County Championship.\n",
        "The cut, which took the markets by surprise, was the first since 2012, and comes into effect on Saturday. The one-year lending rate will be reduced by 25 basis points to 4.6%, and the one-year deposit rate will fall to 1.75%, the People's Bank of China announced. This move is seen as a direct response to slowing economic growth and a struggling property market.\n\nAnalysts believe the central bank is attempting to stimulate borrowing and investment, hoping to inject much-needed liquidity into the economy. The reduction in the deposit rate aims to encourage spending rather than saving.\n\nThe unexpected decision sent ripples through global markets, with Asian stocks initially rising on the news. However, some experts have expressed concerns that this could signal deeper problems within the Chinese economy. Whether this rate cut will be sufficient to revive growth remains to be seen, and further easing measures might be on the horizon.\n",
        "The Swiss bank said US regulators were investigating potential sales of so called \"bearer bonds\". These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy individuals to conceal their assets and potentially evade taxes. The investigation, which focuses on the bank's Latin American operations, highlights the ongoing challenges of combating financial secrecy and illicit money flows.\n\nBearer bonds, once a popular tool for tax evasion, have become increasingly rare due to stricter international regulations. Their anonymity makes them attractive to those seeking to hide wealth from authorities. The probe could lead to substantial fines and reputational damage for the bank if wrongdoing is found. Regulators worldwide are cracking down on financial institutions that facilitate tax evasion and money laundering, signaling a growing commitment to transparency and accountability in the global financial system.\n",

Choi, dubbed the \"Korean Rasputin,\" has been arrested on charges of fraud and abuse of power. Prosecutors are investigating whether Park herself was involved in the scheme, potentially facing impeachment if found culpable.\n\nThe firm's heir apparent, Lee Jae-yong, has also been questioned by investigators and faces potential charges. The scandal has sent shockwaves through the country's political and business elite, raising questions about transparency and accountability at the highest levels.

This move could potentially disrupt the current online retail landscape, challenging established players like Amazon.\n\nThe introduction of the buy button represents a significant step for Google into the e-commerce realm. It remains to be seen how this feature will be received by both consumers and retailers, but it certainly signals Google's growing ambition beyond its core search business.\n",
        "The Black Caps, having been set a world record 504 to win, resumed on 142-3 and their challenge quickly folded. Brendon McCullum was dismissed early, caught behind off the bowling of Stuart Broad, leaving the visitors reeling. Any lingering hopes of a miraculous escape were swiftly extinguished as England's bowlers ripped through the New Zealand batting lineup.\n\nJames Anderson, in particular, was in devastating form, finishing with figures of 5-42. The Black Caps were eventually bowled out for just 253, handing England a comprehensive 251-run victory and a 1-0 series lead. The New Zealand batsmen struggled to cope with the movement and bounce generated by the English attack, with only Ross Taylor offering any real resistance with a battling 76.

The official stated that legal action had begun to recover the debt.\n\nCardiff Aviation provides aircraft maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services, as well as pilot training. Dickinson, a qualified pilot, established the business with the aim of creating skilled jobs in the area. The revelation of unpaid rent raises concerns about the company's financial stability and its future at the St Athan site.

Despite her numerous pleas for help to Nottinghamshire Police, the authorities failed to take adequate action.\n\nTragically, just weeks later, Hutsby brutally attacked the woman, leaving her with life-altering injuries. He was subsequently convicted of grievous bodily harm and sentenced to 12 years in prison.\n\nA recent investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has revealed a catalogue of failings by Nottinghamshire Police in their handling of the case. The IOPC found that officers had not properly assessed the risk posed by Hutsby and had failed to adequately safeguard the victim.

Thomas himself has also enjoyed personal success, currently sitting in fourth place overall, a testament to his strength and endurance. While his primary focus remains on helping Froome secure victory in Paris, Thomas's impressive performance has sparked speculation about his potential as a future Tour contender.

They claim current standards are inadequate, leading to issues like drivers getting lost and being unable to understand customer needs.\n\nHowever, critics, including drivers' unions, have slammed the plans as discriminatory. They argue that the new tests could unfairly penalize drivers from ethnic minorities and those for whom English is a second language, potentially pushing them out of the industry. The consultation period will allow various stakeholders to voice their opinions before a final decision is made. The outcome will significantly impact London's private hire industry and the thousands who rely on it for their livelihood.\n",

Walsall continued to press after the break, but it was West Brom who broke the deadlock on 52 minutes. A swift counter-attack saw Harvey Barnes feed Jay Rodriguez, who coolly slotted past Liam Roberts.\n\nThe Baggies doubled their lead just ten minutes later, with Barnes again the provider. This time, his cross found Dwight Gayle, who headed home from close range. Walsall struggled to create clear-cut chances in response, and West Brom comfortably saw out the remainder of the match.\n\nThe victory sees West Brom progress to the next round of the cup, while Walsall will be left to rue their missed opportunities.

The isolated nation, known for its strict regime and limited tourism, has garnered over 30% of the total votes. Trailing behind are more traditional tourist destinations like Italy and Japan, each with around 15% of the vote.\n\nThe poll, conducted by a popular travel blogger, was intended as a lighthearted way to engage his audience. However, the overwhelming support for North Korea has sparked a debate. Some argue that visiting the country could legitimize its government, while others see it as an opportunity for cultural exchange and understanding.\n\nThe blogger has yet to announce his final decision, but the poll results have undoubtedly given him plenty to consider.\n",

        "Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales participated in the study, which analyzed domestic abuse cases. The research highlighted a tendency to prioritize physical violence when assessing risk, potentially neglecting other crucial indicators like controlling behavior, stalking, and threats to kill.\n\nThis narrow focus could lead to inadequate safety planning and support for victims experiencing non-violent but equally dangerous forms of abuse. Experts emphasize that coercive control, a pattern of behavior aimed at dominating a partner, is a significant precursor to serious harm. The College of Policing is urging forces to adopt a more holistic approach, considering the full spectrum of abusive behaviors when evaluating risk and implementing safeguarding measures. They advocate for improved training to better equip officers to identify and respond effectively to all forms of domestic abuse, regardless of the presence of physical violence.\n",

Despite this, the bills are expected to face strong resistance from opposition lawmakers.\n\nThe proposed security bills reinterpret Japan's pacifist constitution, which currently forbids the use of force to settle international disputes. Abe argues the changes are necessary to ensure Japan's security in the face of a rising China and a nuclear-armed North Korea.\n\nCritics, however, fear the move could entangle Japan in US-led conflicts and erode the nation's post-war commitment to peace.
