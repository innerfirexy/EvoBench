You've just lived through the second death of the universe and show no sign of stopping. Death is baffled. \"How?\" he asked, his voice still as cold as the day I met him. \"After eons and eons of heartbreak and loss, war and hatred, how are you still in love with life?\" \"It's simple, really.\" I replied, \"You of all people should know of the circle.\" \"The circle!

Their mother had died last week in a territory battle. We don't get those much in the reserve because of the large space and abundant resources, but it still happens. This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest. I knew her hatchlings would be too young to fend for themselves. I found them easily. She hadn't moved them since I stumbled upon them the first time, likely too weak from the cancer.

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle. Breaking the seal on the letter, I unrolled it, reading the letter. *Dear Hanna, If you are reading this, then I have failed. We are cursed, and soon it will pass to you.

The faded sun rose through the horizon in the smog filled skies of Rome. I trudged through beggars and merchants on my way to another hard day at the docks. The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The long walk to work provided ample time to daydream about warm meals and deep sleep, luxuries of a distant past. But I didn't have time to daydream today. I couldn't afford to be late. Again. As I neared the docks, my eyes were drawn to a nearby newsstand.

You are free to leave, and my only order is this: I forbid you to shame any soldier who chooses to walk away.

Most couples have a song, we had a small path that began just inside Gateway Park. My favorite things were the plants. Big, small, leafy, sprightly, nothing really fascinated me so much as watching something grow, watching it slowly make progress, fighting against the sky. I was drawn to the ground, I suppose.

The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge.",

I didn't realize what that would turn me into. I now serve as part of a unit of highly trained specialist soldiers. We afford the government a high degree of deniability, because as far as they are concerned, we don't exist. I've done things, horrible things, as a result of working with this group of men.

      "[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the ultimate theme of The Dark Tower series. Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument. No matter how well-formed her thoughts were, they came out as quips. She wasn't a",

I began to keep an eye out, get an idea of where she would be in comparison to me.'Stalk' is too strong a word, it was more that I paid attention to what she did more than is usual. A small conversation on the way to class was a victory, a wave and exchange of greetings progress. She became more important to me than I thought possible.

Fewer gestures, more constraint when she was supposed to be care free, joyous and brilliant. Great dark circles formed under her",
      "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

For three eternities their drama unfolded. They littered the darkness with the refuse of battle. As Destruction struck a mighty blow, a single drop of blood fell from the brow of Creation. It splattered against a drifting bone from the rib of Destruction. The blood and bone warped and twisted as it hurtled through the dark.

The phenomenon has been documented in over 200 documented cases, with some demons reportedly experiencing unprecedented vulnerability and emotional distress.\n\nSupernatural historians suggest this breakthrough could fundamentally alter the balance of power between human and infernal dimensions. While the long-term implications remain unclear, one thing is certain: the underworld",
      "At age 18 you are required to go to city hall and have someone read you through a choose your own adventure style book of your life while you sit nervously, wondering which paths you've already unconsciously selected. The bureaucratic official turns each page methodically, their finger tracing potential timelines and subtle divergences that led you to this moment.\n\nSome choices were made in childhood - a kind word here, a hesitation there - that subtly redirected your trajectory. Others were more deliberate: the college you chose, the job you accepted, the relationship you pursued or abandoned. The book feels heavy with possibility and consequence.\n\nYou realize that life isn't about perfect choices, but about understanding how each decision interconnects and shapes your narrative. The official looks up, waiting for you to confirm or challenge the path revealed. Your heart races. This moment feels both predetermined and startlingly open, a paradox of personal agency and mysterious",
      "[ IP ] The Black Blade. I shall not go. I shall not. I refuse to return to that cursed ever-frozen place, where shadows dance between jagged ice peaks and whispers of ancient legends echo through endless white valleys.\n\nMy hands still tremble remembering the last expedition, how we lost three men to the merciless cold and something else\u2014something that moved between snowdrifts with predatory silence. The Black Blade expedition had seemed like a simple geological survey, mapping uncharted territories in the Arctic's most remote regions.\n\nBut we discovered more than geological formations. Strange markings carved into glacial walls suggested an intelligence far older than human understanding. Strange symbols that seemed to pulse with an unearthly energy, hinting at forgotten civilizations or something beyond comprehension.\n\nNo amount of research funding or scientific curiosity could compel me to return",
      "CW: Create a character I feel strongly for (love/hate/sympathize) using a monologue from their perspective\n\nCharacter development is the heart of compelling storytelling. When writers craft narratives that invite readers to deeply connect emotionally with a protagonist, they transform mere words into living, breathing experiences. The key lies not in elaborate plot twists, but in authentic, vulnerable character revelations.\n\nA powerful monologue can serve as a window into a character's soul, revealing their innermost thoughts, fears, and motivations. By allowing readers to hear directly from the character, writers create an intimate connection that transcends traditional narrative boundaries. The most memorable characters are those who feel profoundly human\u2014flawed, complex, and relatable.\n\nEffective character creation requires empathy, psychological insight, and a willingness to explore uncomfortable emotional territories. Writers must be willing to strip away external facades and expose the",

      "Meet & Greet/Weekly Question # 3: What do you look for in a WP response? What do I look for in a WP\n\nWhen diving into the world of writing prompts (WP), I seek more than just surface-level narratives. A compelling response should transcend mere description, weaving intricate emotional landscapes that resonate deeply with readers. Authenticity is paramount\u2014I want stories that pulsate with genuine human experience, where characters breathe and struggles feel tangible.\n\nCreativity becomes the cornerstone of an exceptional WP response. I appreciate unexpected narrative twists, innovative perspectives that challenge conventional storytelling. A response that takes a prompt and transforms it into something profoundly unique captures my imagination instantly.\n\nTechnical craftsmanship matters too.

      "Life and Death decide to switch places for a time to see which of their jobs is harder. Death looked across the stars, at the glowing figure of Life, who seemed both curious and apprehensive about their impending role swap.\n\nLife found herself overwhelmed almost immediately. The intricate balance of nurturing, protecting, and guiding countless organisms was far more complex than she had imagined. Each breath required careful orchestration, each heartbeat a delicate negotiation between survival and potential failure.\n\nDeath, conversely, discovered that creating was exponentially more challenging than ending. He struggled to understand the nuanced processes of growth, cellular regeneration, and the subtle art of maintaining biological systems. The constant decision-making required to sustain life felt like an impossible puzzle.\n\nBy the experiment's end, both entities gained profound respect for each other's responsibilities. They realized that their roles were not competing forces,",
      "The monster in the closet finally lures the child into the darkness, only to realize something is very very wrong. The beast peered through the small crack between the door and the wall, watching the trembling silhouette of the young boy. For years, it had waited, cultivating fear like a delicate garden, nurturing each whispered nightmare and shadowy movement.\n\nTonight was different.

But as the boy crossed the threshold, something shifted. The darkness around them began to pulse with an unfamiliar energy.\n\nSuddenly, the monster felt a chill. The child's eyes, now gleaming with an unnatural light, locked onto its own. In that moment, the hunter became the hunted. The creature realized, with",
      "You are a compulsive liar. Convince me you are not. In order to be a good liar\u2014the best liar\u2014you have to understand the intricate psychology of deception. It's not about crafting elaborate tales, but about believability, subtlety, and emotional manipulation.\n\nThe most skilled liars don't just fabricate stories; they weave narratives that tap into human vulnerabilities. They read people, understand their desires and fears, and construct responses that resonate on a deeply personal level. A masterful lie isn't just a string of words, but a carefully orchestrated performance that triggers empathy, doubt, and ultimately, trust.\n\nBut here's the irony: true mastery of deception requires an almost paradoxical commitment to truth. The best liars know that occasional vulnerability, small admissions of imperfection, make their larger fabrications more credible. They understand that",

This thing was finally dead after four long years of relentless pursuit.\n\nThe creature had stalked the shadows of our city, consuming hope and leaving only despair in its wake. Its grotesque form, a mixture of human nightmares and primal terror, had haunted my dreams since that first encounter in the abandoned warehouse district.\n\nEach battle had chipped away at my humanity, forcing me to confront the darkness within myself. But this final confrontation was different. As its lifeless form crumbled into ash, I felt a profound sense of liberation. The weight of countless sleepless nights, of endless tracking and fighting, dissolved into a quiet, resolute peace.\n\nI was no longer a hunter. I was finally whole.",

Though her slightly hunched posture subtly indicated she carried a weight beyond her years, her eyes sparkled with an unexpected vibrancy. The leaves around her danced in crimson and gold, swirling like memories of a forgotten promise.\n\nWhen Death ceased to exist, the world transformed. No more suffering, no more final goodbyes, no more grief. Immortality wasn't a blessing, but a strange new reality that humanity was struggling to comprehend.

The concept of wireless communication seemed like pure sorcery to him. I demonstrated by pulling up a map, showing him how I could see streets and landscapes from distant lands without moving. When I video-called a friend, the merchant nearly dropped his woven bag, stunned by the moving, talking image.\n\n\"In my time,\" I explained patiently, \"this device connects humans across continents, translates languages instantly, and stores more information than entire libraries in your era.

At just nine years old, I sensed something profound in his sorrow. One summer afternoon, while playing in my yard, I noticed him sitting on his porch, staring blankly at a faded photograph.\n\nCuriosity led me to approach him, clutching a handful of wildflowers I'd picked. \"These are for you,\" I said softly. To my surprise, he looked up, his weathered eyes meeting mine. I sat beside him, uninvited but unafraid.\n\nOver weeks, I would visit, sharing stories about my day, my school, and my dreams.

As it flowed, strange whispers began to echo from the drain\u2014soft, unintelligible murmurs that made the hair on her arms stand up.\n\nShe remembered the old woman's warning: \"Some houses keep secrets in their plumbing.\" Elena had laughed then, dismissing it as folklore.
