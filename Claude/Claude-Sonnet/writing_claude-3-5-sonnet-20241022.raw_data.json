Their mother had died last week in a territory battle. We don't get those much in the reserve because of the large space and abundant resources, but it still happens. This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest.

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle.

The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The long walk to work provided ample time to daydream about warm meals and deep sleep, luxuries of a distant past. But I didn't have time to daydream today. I couldn't afford to be late. Again.

Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar",

        "[ TT ] Heron of Alexandria realizes that his Aeolipile can be used as a steam engine. The industrial revolution begins in the first century AD, forever altering the course of human history. What started as a curious spinning device powered by steam jets soon transforms into the driving force behind automated machinery in the Roman Empire.\n\nWorkshops across Alexandria begin incorporating steam power into their production processes. The efficiency of manufacturing increases tenfold, and soon the innovation spreads throughout the Mediterranean. Roman engineers adapt the technology for mining, textile production, and even maritime navigation.\n\nBy 150 AD, steam-powered vessels regularly cross the Mediterranean, while automated mills process grain at unprecedented rates. The Roman Empire's technological advantage helps maintain its dominance well beyond its historical collapse.\n\nThe early industrialization creates new social classes, environmental challenges, and philosophical debates about the role of machinery in society. Scholars still debate whether this premature industrial revolution was a blessing or a",
