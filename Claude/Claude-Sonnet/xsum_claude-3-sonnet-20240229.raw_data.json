        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James",

The NHSBT said ethnic minority groups, who were more likely to have B negative blood, were more prone to sickle cell anaemia, where misshapen blood cells could block blood vessels, causing an early death. It also said such groups were more at risk of developing thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders that hindered the blood's ability to carry oxygen.

The report suggests that the success of the London Challenge program, which focused on improving teaching and leadership in the capital's schools, could provide valuable lessons for other regions.\n\nThe IPPR's findings highlight the stark educational divide between different parts of the country, with the gap between London and the North East being particularly pronounced.

        "The Republican sought to laugh off the comment, which was preceded by the supporter saying: \"We have a problem in this country - it's called Muslims.\" The controversial remark drew gasps from the crowd, but the candidate quickly attempted to defuse the situation with a joke. \"We're going to be politically correct here, folks,\" he said with a chuckle, before pivoting to a familiar talking point about securing the nation's borders.\n\nThe incident highlighted the tightrope many Republican candidates are walking as they try to appeal to a base that has grown increasingly hostile toward immigrants and minorities, while also avoiding rhetoric that could alienate more moderate voters. It also underscored the challenges of controlling the narrative at raucous campaign events, where off-the-cuff comments from attendees can quickly go viral and overshadow the intended message of the day.",

From his stance on immigration reform to his plans for revitalizing the economy, he's not shying away from tackling the tough issues head-on. \n\nHowever, his approach has drawn both praise and criticism from various quarters. Supporters laud his willingness to break from the status quo and address long-standing problems with fresh ideas. Detractors, on the other hand, accuse him of being too brash and divisive, with policies that could potentially alienate certain segments of the population.\n\nAs Mr. Johnson settles into his new role, all eyes are on him to see if he can deliver on his ambitious promises while navigating the complex political landscape.

        "That amount is equivalent to the combined economies of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, the report by the Institute for Policy Studies revealed. The staggering figure highlights the alarming wealth disparity plaguing the global economy. The report found that the richest 1% of the world's population now owns nearly half of the planet's total wealth, while the bottom 50% holds a mere 1%. This concentration of wealth in the hands of a privileged few not only exacerbates economic inequality but also undermines social stability and hinders economic growth. Experts warn that unless decisive action is taken to address this issue, the consequences could be severe, leading to increased social unrest and a further erosion of trust in institutions and systems. The report calls for comprehensive reforms, including progressive taxation, strengthening of labor rights, and increased investment in public services to create a more equitable society.",

The volcano, one of the most active in the world, has been erupting more frequently in recent years, with ash plumes reaching up to 5,000 meters high. The researchers warn that the increasing activity could lead to a major eruption, potentially affecting the nearby city of Kagoshima and its surrounding areas. \n\nThe study, published in the journal Nature Communications, analyzed data from satellite observations and ground-based monitoring to track the volcano's behavior. They found that the magma chamber beneath Sakurajima has been steadily expanding, indicating a buildup of pressure. This increased pressure could eventually trigger a more explosive eruption, similar to the one that occurred in 1914, which caused significant damage and casualties.\n\nLocal authorities are taking the findings seriously and have implemented evacuation plans and monitoring systems to mi",

However, some analysts remain skeptical about the effectiveness of the measure, citing the need for more comprehensive reforms to address underlying structural issues in the Chinese economy. Nevertheless, the move signals the authorities' willingness to take action in supporting growth, which could help alleviate concerns about a potential hard landing.",
        "The Swiss bank said US regulators were investigating potential sales of so-called \"bearer bonds\". These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy individuals to conceal assets from tax authorities. The probe highlights concerns over the use of such financial instruments for tax evasion and money laundering purposes. Bearer bonds, which are debt securities that entitle the holder to claim the cash flows, have largely been phased out in major markets due to their lack of transparency. However, they remain available in some jurisdictions, making them attractive for those seeking to obscure ownership trails. The bank stated that it was cooperating fully with the authorities but could not provide further details due to the ongoing investigation. The scrutiny underscores the global crackdown on financial secrecy and the use of opaque structures to shelter wealth from taxation.",
        "The firm is accused of giving large donations to non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a close confidante of Ms Park. The allegations have sparked widespread public outrage and massive protests demanding the president's resignation. Ms Park has apologized for the scandal but has denied any legal wrongdoing, insisting that she only received help from Ms Choi on editing a small number of speeches. However, prosecutors allege that Ms Choi used her relationship with the president to gain influence and secure favors from businesses. The scandal has paralyzed the Park administration and deepened the nation's political turmoil. Opposition parties have been pushing for the president's impeachment, while her approval ratings have plunged to record lows. The investigation is ongoing, and the outcome could have far-reaching implications for South Korea's political landscape.",
        "The button would give Google Search users the option to purchase without needing to visit a separate website. The company's chief business officer, Omid Kordestani, announced the new feature at an advertising conference in San Francisco. This move is seen as Google's attempt to keep users within its ecosystem and compete with Amazon's dominance in online shopping.\n\nThe \"buy\" button will appear alongside sponsored results when users search for specific products on Google.com. Clicking on it will bring up a product listing page with pricing, seller ratings, and the option to complete the purchase through Google's secure checkout process. The search giant plans to take a cut of each sale, providing a new revenue stream beyond advertising.\n\nThis integration could be a game-changer for retailers, allowing them to capitalize on Google's massive search traffic. However, concerns have been raised about the potential for Google to favor its own shopping service over competitors' listings.",
        "The Black Caps, having been set a world record 504 to win, resumed on 142-3 and their challenge quickly folded. Brendon McCullum's dismissal for 25 triggered a collapse as they were bowled out for 195 in their second innings. England won the first Test by 170 runs to go 1-0 up in the two-match series. Ben Stokes was named player of the match for his blistering 163 in England's mammoth first innings total. The hosts' aggressive approach with the bat paid dividends, putting the Black Caps under immense scoreboard pressure throughout. Despite a defiant 92 from Tom Blundell, New Zealand's batting ultimately crumbled in the face of England's relentless bowling attack. The teams will now head to Nottingham for the second and final Test, with the Black Caps needing to regroup quickly",
        "An official has told an assembly committee that Cardiff Aviation, which has leased a hangar at St Athan from the administration since 2012, has not paid any rent for the past three years. The revelation came during a scrutiny session examining the Welsh Government's management of its property portfolio. The company, which provides aircraft maintenance services, was supposed to be paying \u00a3120,000 per year for the use of the hangar.\n\nHowever, officials admitted that the last rental payment was received in 2020, and since then, the company has accrued arrears of \u00a3360,000. The committee expressed concern over the situation and questioned why more robust action had not been taken to recover the outstanding amount. The Welsh Government stated that it was in discussions with Cardiff Aviation to resolve the issue, but the committee urged for a more proactive approach to protect taxpayers' interests.",
        "The number given for the current account customers hit by the fraud is fewer than half of the 20,000 initially reported to have been affected.

The bank has assured customers that immediate steps were taken to contain the breach and enhance security protocols. However, many customers remain uneasy about the potential misuse of their personal data. Authorities are investigating the matter, and the bank has promised to compensate those affected by the breach.

However, Hutsby persistently violated these conditions, subjecting the woman to a harrowing ordeal of harassment and intimidation.\n\nDespite the victim's multiple reports to the authorities, the situation escalated, leading to a terrifying incident on July 28th. Hutsby forcibly entered the woman's home, leaving her fearing for her life.

        "Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, and a practical driving exam for all private hire drivers in the capital. The proposals come as part of a package of measures aimed at improving safety and standards in the private hire industry, following several high-profile incidents involving drivers. \n\nUnder the new rules, applicants would be required to pass an advanced English test, demonstrating their ability to communicate effectively with passengers. They would also need to pass a map-reading test, ensuring they can navigate the city's streets without relying solely on GPS. Additionally, all private hire drivers would have to undergo a practical driving assessment, testing their skills behind the wheel.\n\nTfL says the measures are necessary to ensure that private hire drivers have the necessary skills and knowledge to operate safely and professionally in London. The consultation period will run for six weeks, with the new requirements expected to come into force later this",
        "The Saddlers looked more likely to take the lead in the first half, with Albion goalkeeper Jon McLaughlin keeping out Paul Downing and Romaine Sawyers' efforts. However, the visitors struck first in the 51st minute when Matt Phillips' cross was turned home by Hal Robson-Kanu. Walsall responded well and levelled through Erhun Oztumer's deflected shot, but the Baggies regained the lead almost immediately through Salomon Rondon's header. The home side pushed hard for an equaliser, but West Brom held firm to secure their place in the fourth round. Despite the defeat, Walsall can take heart from their performance against Premier League opposition and will now turn their attention back to their League One promotion push.",
        "A website polled users as to which country he should tour next, with no restrictions on the nations that could be voted on. There are now almost 200 countries in the world, and the results of the poll were quite surprising. While popular tourist destinations like Italy, France, and Japan received a significant number of votes, the country that emerged as the clear winner was North Korea.\n\nDespite being one of the most isolated and restrictive nations on the planet, North Korea garnered an overwhelming majority of votes from the website's users. This unexpected outcome has sparked debates and discussions about the motivations behind such a choice. Some speculate that the curiosity surrounding North Korea's secretive society and the desire to witness its unique cultural and historical sites drove the votes. Others suggest that the thrill of visiting a place deemed off-limits by many governments added an element of adventure and intrigue to the decision.",

The winner will be announced later this year, and the public is encouraged to vote and appreciate the significance of these living monuments.",
        "Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales were examined, and it was found that officers primarily responded to incidents involving physical violence, ignoring other potential indicators of domestic abuse, such as coercive control and emotional manipulation.\n\nThe study highlighted the need for better training and awareness among law enforcement personnel to recognize the various forms of domestic abuse. Experts emphasized that physical violence is often just one aspect of a broader pattern of abusive behavior, which can include psychological, financial, and sexual abuse.\n\nThe findings underscore the importance of a comprehensive approach to addressing domestic violence, taking into account the complex dynamics and power imbalances present in abusive relationships. Failure to recognize and respond to non-physical forms of abuse can leave victims vulnerable and perpetuate a cycle of control and harm.",
        "The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two. The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house, and is expected to be approved by the upper house later this year. This controversial move has sparked protests across Japan, with many citizens concerned about the potential remilitarization of their country. However, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe argues that the changes are necessary to better protect Japan's security interests in an increasingly unstable region. Under the new laws, Japan's military could provide logistical support to allies during UN-approved conflicts, and even engage in combat to defend allied troops. Critics fear this could eventually lead to Japanese involvement in overseas wars, a sharp departure from the country's long-standing pacifist stance. Supporters counter that the changes are long overdue given the growing threats Japan faces from countries like China and North Korea.",

        "The site is believed to contain thousands of copies of a video game called ET The Extra-Terrestrial. A company called Atari made the game in 1982, based on the popular Steven Spielberg film. However, the game was poorly received by critics and players alike, with complaints about its repetitive gameplay and confusing design.\n\nAfter failing to sell as expected, Atari reportedly buried millions of unsold cartridges in a landfill in Alamogordo, New Mexico. For decades, this story was treated as an urban legend, until a documentary crew excavated the site in 2014 and found hundreds of E.T. cartridges buried there.\n\nThe discovery reignited interest in the infamous game and its troubled history.

        "The Lyndhurst Park Hotel, once linked to smuggling, was visited by Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson. Developer PegasusLife wants to replace it with a retirement complex. The Grade II listed building in Lyndhurst, Hampshire, dates back to the 16th century and has a sordid history. During the 18th century, it was a coaching inn and rumored to be a base for smugglers transporting contraband from the nearby coast.
