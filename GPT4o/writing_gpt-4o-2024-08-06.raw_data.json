Death is baffled. \"How?\" he asked, his voice still as cold as the day I met him. \"After eons and eons of heartbreak and loss, war and hatred, how are you still in love with life?\" \"It's simple, really.\" I replied, \"You of all people should know of the circle.\" \"The circle!

Their mother had died last week in a territory battle. We don't get those much in the reserve because of the large space and abundant resources, but it still happens. This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest. I knew her hatchlings would be too young to fend for themselves. I found them easily. She hadn't moved them since I stumbled upon them the first time, likely too weak from the cancer.",

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle.

The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake.

You are free to leave, and my only order is this: I forbid you to shame any soldier who chooses to walk away.

The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze",

I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument. No matter how well-formed her thoughts were, they came out as quips. She wasn't a genius, but she would never stoop to one-liners if she had a choice.",

A small conversation on the way to class was a victory, a wave and exchange of greetings progress. She became more important to me than I thought possible. Then a day came where her smiles were hesitant, beginning timidly and ending much too soon. Her eyes would flick from surface to surface, wavering as she tried to distract herself. Fewer gestures, more constraint when she was supposed to be care free, joyous and brilliant. Great dark circles formed under her eyes and long sleeves become a frequent part",
        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

She whispered the words again, as if saying them aloud could somehow stop the inevitable changes that loomed in her life.\n\nTomorrow, her family would move to a new city, far from the friends she had known her whole life. The thought of leaving her best friend behind made her heart ache in a way she had never experienced before. Her rabbit, its fur worn from countless hugs, was her one constant, a source of comfort in the uncertainty of tomorrow.\n\nIn her small hands, the rabbit seemed to nod in understanding, its presence",
        "Explain a piece of modern technology to a person from around 100-500 CE. \"Look, are you even trying to understand?

This is what we call a smartphone.\n\nCenturies ahead of your time, we've crafted a small, flat device capable of capturing and displaying images, words, and sounds. It\u2019s like an entire library or theater that fits in your hand. Instead of ink and parchment, it uses invisible pulses that travel through the air to connect with others across great distances.\n\nWith just a touch, you can converse with someone thousands of miles away, see their face, and hear their voice. Its power comes not from the gods, but from human ingenuity, using tiny fragments of earth to create something akin to a living mosaic. This device opens doors to the realm of information and connection beyond any known boundary.",
        "A little girl helps her neighbor overcome his vow of silence he made after his wife passed away 40 years ago. I've lived next door to Mr. Thompson my whole life, watching him tend to his garden with a quiet dedication. After his wife's passing, he stopped speaking to anyone, a silence that became as much a part of him as his old woolen cap.\n\nOne day, while chasing after my runaway kite, I stumbled into his garden. Seeing his roses up close, I couldn't help but comment on their beauty. To my surprise, he nodded, and there was a flicker of something in his eyes. Encouraged, I visited him daily, sharing stories about school and my mischievous cat.\n\nSlowly, he began to respond with gestures and eventually, words. \"It's been a long time,\" he softly said one afternoon. Mr. Thompson's voice, though rusty, was filled with gratitude, and from that day forward, silence was no longer his companion.",

It's for you. I park my car beside the bridge over the shimmering creek, clutching the ancient glass vessel with a sense of awe and disbelief. The bottle's surface, etched with the passage of time, sparkles under the sun. Seagulls cry overhead as the gentle waves kiss the shore, a reminder of the journey this relic has taken through the decades.\n\nCuriosity piqued, I gingerly uncork the bottle and extract the fragile, yellowed paper. Unfurling it with care, I reveal a note penned in elegant cursive. The message, though faded, speaks of love and longing from a time long past. It tells a tale of a sailor lost at sea, sending one last whisper to the world. I stand there, touched by the words meant for someone else, yet feeling their weight as if they were meant for me all along.",

She tried the knob on the left, and hot water came out of the tap, steaming up the small bathroom. Curious, she turned the knob on the right, and cold water flowed, as expected. But it was the third knob in the center that intrigued her most. It was slightly larger, embossed with an intricate pattern that seemed to shimmer under the pale light.\n\nWith a sense of anticipation, she turned it ever so gently.
