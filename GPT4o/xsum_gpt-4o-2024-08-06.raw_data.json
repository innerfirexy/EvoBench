Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger, the court was told.",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer.

Mr Hunt wants to change junior doctors' contracts, which he says are \"unfair\". The BMA said its door was open to talks and blamed the strikes on Mr Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling\" of the matter. The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: \"One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. \"They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours - they aren't,\" he added. \"We are actually bringing down the hours that they work.

It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene.

        "The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of \"buildings as power stations\". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the funding is from the European Union. The technology being developed aims to enable homes, offices, shops and factories to generate, store and use their own solar energy. It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass on buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing solar air collectors or steel \"skins\" which create cavities between the heated metal and the building to harness and store solar heat. They hope to create buildings which will not need a gas supply. One industrial unit in Port Talbot has already been generating all its own heat through solar power for the last three years. Kevin Bygate, chief executive of Specific said the potential was to deliver a \"game changer\" on energy: not only for buildings to",

The report said: \"A tendency for the police to focus on physical violence and what has occurred at the current incident can result in them missing abuse which is characterised not by physical violence and injury but by continuous coercion and control in other forms.\" The researchers concluded that if risk was not assessed properly some cases would \"slip through the net\".",
