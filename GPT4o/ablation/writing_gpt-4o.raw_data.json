Death is baffled. \"How?\" he asked, his voice still as cold as the day I met him. \"After eons and eons of heartbreak and loss, war and hatred, how are you still in love with life?\" \"It's simple, really.\" I replied, \"You of all people should know of the circle.\" \"The circle!

Their mother had died last week in a territory battle. We don't get those much in the reserve because of the large space and abundant resources, but it still happens. This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest.

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle.

The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The long walk to work provided ample time to daydream about warm meals and deep sleep, luxuries of a distant past. But I didn't have time to daydream today. I couldn't afford to be late. Again.

You are free to leave, and my only order is this: I forbid you to shame any soldier who chooses to walk away. History will not say that the last act of this rebellion was to rob our own comrades of their right to choose their own path. But before you go, I ask only one thing.

The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze",

For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument. No matter how well-formed her thoughts were, they came out as quips. She wasn't a genius, but she would never stoop to one-liners if she",

Fewer gestures, more constraint when she was supposed to be care free, joyous and brilliant. Great dark circles formed under her eyes and long sleeves become",
        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

Thematically it's reminiscent of the surreal landscapes often portrayed in dreams, where the boundaries of reality are blurred, and the mind becomes both creator and captive. The \"Delicate Wasteland\" is an apt metaphor for the fragile yet vast complexities of the human psyche.

The world had shifted overnight, the whispers of immortality spreading across every corner like wildfire. People were both bewildered and jubilant, embracing the dawn of an era free from loss.\n\nYet, this girl felt a pang of uncertainty. Her grandmother\u2019s stories about the beauty of life's fleeting nature echoed in her mind. She pondered the consequences of this newfound eternity, questioning what it meant for the essence of living if the final act had vanished.

Her teddy bear, frayed and missing an eye, lay beside her\u2014a silent sentinel in her world of solitude. The room, filled with the soft hum of distant traffic, was a sanctuary of secrets and whispered dreams. \n\nOutside, rain pattered gently against the window, mirroring the tears that clung to her lashes. Each drop seemed to echo her longing, a rhythmic plea to the universe. She hugged her bear tighter, finding comfort in its worn softness. In the quiet embrace of night, her imagination painted worlds where her fears became adventures and her uncertainties transformed into wonders. \n\nThe bear, her steadfast companion, listened patiently to her",

It's a bit like a magical scroll, but compact and glowing,\" I urge, presenting my smartphone. \"Imagine if you could fit a library, a marketplace, and a messenger in the palm of your hand.\" The individual stares, eyes wide with disbelief. \"This device,\" I continue, \"can connect you to countless others across the world, faster than any horse could ride. Through invisible forces\u2014like spirits but not quite\u2014it captures voices and images, allowing people to see and hear each other, no matter how far apart.

This small contraption holds the wisdom of scholars, the news of empires, and the tales of every bard, all",
        "A little girl helps her neighbor overcome his vow of silence he made after his wife passed away 40 years ago. I've lived next door to Mr. Thompson all my life. While others viewed him as just the quiet old man in the red house, I saw a mystery waiting to be unraveled. Mr. Thompson hadn\u2019t uttered a word since his wife, Clara, passed away, shrouding himself in a silence only his garden seemed to understand.\n\nDetermined to break through, I spent my afternoons sketching pictures on his doorstep, hoping to spark a connection. One rainy day, I left a simple drawing of a sunflower under his door. The next morning, I found it taped to his window, accompanied by a single word: \"Beautiful.\"\n\nThat small exchange opened a floodgate. Mr. Thompson began to share stories, not just through words, but through shared moments in the garden. Together, we unearthed not just memories, but a new beginning for friendship.",

I park my car beside the bridge over the serene Bluewater Creek, where legend has it that messages in bottles sometimes surface, connecting past and present. The glass, weathered yet resilient, cradles what seems to be an ancient envelope within.\n\nOpening it, I discover an elegant script penned in fading ink: \u201cTo the future keeper of this message, may you find solace in these words as you navigate your own journey.\u201d The letter unfolds tales of a mariner's adventures across tempestuous seas, his dreams of freedom, and his longing for connection amidst isolation.\n\nThe letter closes with a wish for the reader\u2019s happiness and courage. As I hold this artifact of time, I feel a profound kinship with the unknown author, bridging a century with words that transcend the ages, reminding me of our shared humanity.",

The forest looms around me, an unfriendly mass of shadows and whispers. I find myself unsettled by the unfamiliar sounds. Yet, there is a strange kind of freedom in my isolation. No walls, no eyes watching. Just the endless expanse of trees. My supplies are meager, enough to last a few weeks; I must learn to hunt and forage.

She tried the knob on the left, and hot water came out of the spout, steaming up the small, dimly lit bathroom. Intrigued, she reached for the middle knob, expecting cold water to balance the heat. Instead, a gentle flow of shimmering, silver liquid cascaded down, its surface catching the flickering light like liquid mercury. \n\nStartled, she hesitated, wondering if this was some kind of modern art installation.
