Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat. It's simply what the rule says. The rules are the rules",

But a disciplinary panel ruled contact with the pupil was probably made and her conduct had been \"unacceptable\". On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties. But in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the head or hand. The panel found she had \"acted in an inappropriate way\" and ruled it was",

She said:\"There are some who would say we have no right to remember or to honour them, we have absolutely every right. \"Everyone, it doesn't matter who you are, has the right to remember their dead in a respectful and dignified manner.\" The four IRA men were shot dead after attacking Coalisland police station.

The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme.

Mr Hunt wants to change junior doctors' contracts, which he says are \"unfair\". The BMA said its door was open to talks and blamed the strikes on Mr Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling\" of the matter. The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT.

But the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it would be \"dangerous and reckless\" to get rid of them permanently. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has released three plans to make the savings. It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene. An alternative proposal has been put forward by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore, who recommends putting the 13 fire engines back into service",

On Tuesday evening, the FBI said it was investigating the incident. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters soon after the tweet was published that President Obama was fine, and financial markets quickly recovered the lost ground.

Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. \"In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,\" he said.
