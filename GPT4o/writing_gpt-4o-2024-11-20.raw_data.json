You've just lived through the second death of the universe and show no sign of stopping. Death is baffled. \"How?\" he asked, his voice still as cold as the day I met him. \"After eons and eons of heartbreak and loss, war and hatred, how are you still in love with life?\" \"It's simple, really.\" I replied, \"You of all people should know of the circle.\" \"The circle!

Their mother had died last week in a territory battle. We don't get those much in the reserve because of the large space and abundant resources, but it still happens. This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest.

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle. Breaking the seal on the letter, I unrolled it, reading the letter. *Dear Hanna, If you are reading this, then I have failed. We are cursed, and soon it will pass to you.

The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The long walk to work provided ample time to daydream about warm meals and deep sleep, luxuries of a distant past. But I didn't have time to daydream today. I couldn't afford to be late. Again.

You are free to leave, and my only order is this: I forbid you to shame any soldier who chooses to walk away. History will not say that the last act of this rebellion was to rob our own comrades of their right to choose their own path. But before you go, I ask only one thing.

The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze",

I began to keep an eye out, get an idea of where she would be in comparison to me.'Stalk' is too strong a word, it was more that I paid attention to what she did more than is usual. A small conversation on the way to class was a victory, a wave and exchange of greetings progress. She became more important to me than I thought possible. Then a day came where her smiles were hesitant, beginning timidly and ending much too soon. Her eyes would flick from surface to surface, wavering as she tried to distract herself. Fewer gestures, more constraint when she was supposed to be care free, joyous and brilliant. Great dark circles formed under her eyes and long sleeves",
        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

Her arms, clasped around my neck, felt like a life raft as we stood in the middle of the crowded dance floor. \"Thanks again for coming with me. I don't think I would be able to come alone,\" I said. I looked down at her feet, watching the glowing, soft light of the chandelier bouncing off her shiny deep blue heels. \"Of course.

At [ IP ] **Hidden Harbour by Max Hugo**  \nThis had always been, and hopefully always will be a safe haven. My permanent residence, now. At last, I could breathe\u2014truly breathe\u2014in a way the chaotic outside world never allowed. The harbour, nestled between towering cliffs and swaying palms, was a sanctuary lost to time, a place where whispers of the sea lulled the soul to rest.  \n\nWhen I first arrived, battered by storms both literal and figurative, the locals spoke of its magic. \"Hidden Harbour heals the broken,\" they\u2019d said. I didn\u2019t believe them then. But as days turned to weeks, the salty air and the lull of the waves began to mend what I thought was irreparable.  \n\nThis place had a way of silencing the noise, of simplifying life to its purest essence. Here, disconnected from everything yet profoundly connected to myself, I finally understood the meaning of belonging. Hidden",

Demons of the underworld are now suffering under multiple cases of reverse possession, a phenomenon where humans are able to take control of their tormentors. What began as a desperate ritual by an oppressed exorcist has now turned into a revolutionary tactic, flipping the centuries-old script of fear. Using ancient texts and a surge of collective willpower, humans have learned to infiltrate the minds of demons, forcing them to experience the anguish they so gleefully inflicted.\n\nReports from the underworld suggest chaos, as demons writhe under the weight of guilt, sorrow, and newfound empathy. Some have even begged humans for mercy, offering to sever their ties with our realm. The tables have turned, and humanity is discovering a strange, empowering satisfaction in this role reversal. The once-feared tormentors are now the tormented, and the balance of power has shifted forever.",
