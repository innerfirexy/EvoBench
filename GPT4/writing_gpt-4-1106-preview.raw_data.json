You've just lived through the second death of the universe and show no sign of stopping. Death is baffled. \"How?\" he asked, his voice still as cold as the day I met him. \"After eons and eons of heartbreak and loss, war and hatred, how are you still in love with life?\" \"It's simple, really.\" I replied, \"You of all people should know of the circle.\" \"The circle!

Their mother had died last week in a territory battle. We don't get those much in the reserve because of the large space and abundant resources, but it still happens. This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest. I knew her hatchlings would be too young to fend for themselves. I found them easily. She hadn't moved them since I stumbled upon them the first time, likely too weak",

I toss her over my shoulder and make my way through the house. I watch where I place my feet. A pink bone nearly detonates but I move my foot at the last second. I see the family dog lying on her bed. Or, rather, what's left of it. It's hard to make out this late, but all I can see is shredded blanket. The dog cowers in the back.

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle. Breaking the seal on the letter, I unrolled it, reading the letter. *Dear Hanna, If you are reading this, then I have failed. We are cursed, and soon it will pass to you.

The faded sun rose through the horizon in the smog filled skies of Rome. I trudged through beggars and merchants on my way to another hard day at the docks. The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The long walk to work provided ample time to daydream about warm meals and deep sleep, luxuries of a distant past. But I didn't have time to daydream today. I couldn't afford to be late. Again. As I neared the docks, my eyes were drawn to a nearby newsstand. A graphic image of a red skinned warrior being gunned down",

You are free to leave, and my only order is this: I forbid you to shame any soldier who chooses to walk away. History will not say that the last act of this rebellion was to rob our own comrades of their right to choose their own path. But before you go, I ask only one thing.

Most couples have a song, we had a small path that began just inside Gateway Park. My favorite things were the plants. Big, small, leafy, sprightly, nothing really fascinated me so much as watching something grow, watching it slowly make progress, fighting against the sky. I was drawn to the ground, I suppose.

The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And",

        "[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the ultimate theme of The Dark Tower series. Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument. No matter how well-formed her thoughts were, they came out as quips. She wasn't a genius, but she would never stoop to one-liners if she had a choice.

        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

A friend of his told me about the vow of silence he took, and about his dedication to the wife he lost so tragically all those years ago.

I know what you\u2019re thinking: if I am such a liar, how can you trust anything I say? But that\u2019s where I excel. My lies are never grandiose, never beyond the realms of possibility. They are subtle, like a painter adding a sly stroke to an already intricate canvas.\n\nI pay attention to details, the minutiae that others overlook. In the tilt of my head, the earnestness in my eyes, I project the sincerity of a saint. When I recount tales, they are wrapped in the warmth of familiarity, scented with the fragrance of nostalgia, making you long for a past that never was.\n\nSo, as you sit across from me, eyes narrowed in",
        "Your ascent into sanity began with the thrill of defeating the pure incarnation of evil. The sensation vibrated through every inch of my body, an electrifying confirmation of victory. This thing was finally dead after four harrowing years of relentless pursuit and merciless battles. It had taken root in the darkest recesses of my mind, a parasitic force feeding on fears and insecurities. The world around me had crumbled into chaos, a reflection of the turmoil within. But in this moment of triumph, as the creature's sinister form dissolved into the ether, clarity breached the horizon of my consciousness. I stood amidst the rubble of my own psyche, a survivor of an invisible war. With each breath, the fog of madness lifted, revealing the beauty of a reality that was once shrouded in distortion. The path to reclaiming my mind was now illuminated, a journey not just of recovery, but of rediscovery, and the relentless resilience of the human spirit.",
        "Within a year of birth, every parent receives a small gift or note from their 18-year-old child via time travel. You don't. For 17 years, you've lived with the uncertainty, the whispers of the neighborhood, the pitying looks at the playground. Your child, Jamie, grew up with the same questions in their eyes, the silent wondering why they were different, why the laws of time seemed to exclude them.\n\nThen, on the eve of Jamie's 18th birthday, a shimmering distortion ripples through your living room. From it steps a confident, older Jamie, who smiles knowingly. \"I'm sorry I'm late,\" they say, handing you a tattered, well-loved stuffed rabbit, the same one that will accompany baby Jamie to bed tonight for the first time. \"I wanted to be sure it was the perfect gift. After all, you only get one first time to change time.\"\n\nWith a hug that bridges years and the boundaries of physics",
        "A voice in the sky will tell you when you've left a place for the last time. You tell your significant other goodbye and head out to the unknown, with only the whisper of destiny as your guide. The voice is not heard by all; it is a gift\u2014or a curse\u2014bestowed upon those destined for great change. As you step through the threshold of what was once your sanctuary, the gentle hum begins, a celestial signal that this chapter has ended. Your heart clenches with a mix of sorrow and anticipation. You look back at the love in their eyes, at the life you built together within those walls, trying to commit every detail to memory. The voice, ethereal and tender, assures you that the journey ahead is one of purpose, that the separation is but a necessary interlude in the symphony of your existence. With a deep breath, you turn towards the horizon, the echo of the sky's voice a solemn companion as you embark on your new path.",

Natural light filters in through a large window draped with diaphanous curtains, dancing with the breeze and casting playful shadows.

Though her slightly hunched posture subtly indicated she The day Death died, a young girl sat on a park bench on a brightly colored autumn day. Though her slightly hunched posture subtly indicated she was cloaked in a heavy garment of sadness, the world around her seemed to hum with a peculiar vitality. Leaves danced in a kaleidoscope of reds and golds as if celebrating the end of a long and tyrannical reign. She watched children play, their laughter piercing through the crisp air, untethered by the shadow of mortality that had held humanity in its grip since time immemorial.\n\nDeath had been a constant companion, an inevitability that balanced every joy with its opposite. But now, with its demise, joy was untainted, life unending. The girl contemplated the strange new reality, a world without end.

        "Don't leave me, you're my best friend.\" A little girl sat alone on her bed with her legs tucked tightly to her chest, her small hands clutching the worn edges of a plush rabbit. Tears brimmed in her large, hazel eyes as she whispered to the inanimate companion. The room around her felt too large, the shadows too daunting, and the silence too loud without the familiar giggles and whispers of her best friend, who was moving away to a distant town. The walls, once adorned with shared secrets and dreams, now echoed the hollow goodbye, a symphony of sorrow for childhood friendships paused by the inexorable march of time. In the stillness, the rabbit became her anchor, a soft reminder that the bond they shared transcended distance\u2014a bond that whispered back through the threads of every lovingly sewn stitch: \"You are never truly alone.\"",

        "A little girl helps her neighbor overcome his vow of silence he made after his wife passed away 40 years ago. I've lived next door to Mr. Harrelson since I was born, but I never heard him speak a word. His wife's death had sealed his voice away, a lock without a key, until Ellie moved in across the street. At seven years old, with an inquisitive nature and a heart unscarred by the world's sorrows, Ellie saw Mr. Harrelson not as a silent enigma but as a story waiting to be told. She began visiting him, sitting patiently on his porch, chattering about her school day, her dreams, even what she had for lunch. Her innocence was relentless, her presence a balm to his quiet world.\n\nOne spring afternoon, as the cherry blossoms began to fall like gentle reminders of how beautiful life can be, Ellie asked him what made him happy once.

        "A 101-year old bottle washed up on a beach with a letter inside. It's for you. I park my car beside the bridge over the meandering river and step out into a dance of coastal breezes. The sands, a canvas of time, bear witness to a history of secrets whispered to the waves. My steps slow, drawn by the glint of glass nestled between stones and sea foam. The relic from another century is surprisingly intact, its contents - a faded sheet of paper - curled like a withered leaf within. I retrieve the bottle, uncork it with reverence, and unfurl the delicate missive. The ink, blurred by the years, bears a message that sets my heart adrift: \u201cTo the soul whose hands unfold this letter in a future beyond my reach, know that time is the greatest storyteller. Herein lies a tale of love undimmed by the ages.\u201d The signature at the bottom dances with the same mystery that brought the bottle to my",

My heart beats in tandem with the distant echoes of civilization, growing fainter with each step I take. The weight of solitude settles on my shoulders like the heavy pack I carry. I write by the flickering light of my first campfire, the flames casting long shadows that blend with the coming night.

She tried the knob on the left, and hot water came out of the spout, steaming as it hit the sink. The knob on the right produced a gush of cold, refreshing water, but it was the mysterious middle knob that intrigued her most. Unlike the other two, it was adorned with a strange symbol, a sort of swirl that seemed to pulse with an inner light. With a mix of trepidation and curiosity, she reached out and turned it. Instead of water, what poured forth was an iridescent stream that shimmered in the air, defying gravity and reason. It swirled around her, enveloping her in a whirlwind of colors and sounds that seemed to sing of another world. She stood there, transfixed, as the room around her melted away, leaving her in a place where faucets opened not to sinks, but to the very fabric of the universe."
