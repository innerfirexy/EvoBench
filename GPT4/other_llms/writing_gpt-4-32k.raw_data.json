You've just lived through the second death of the universe and show no sign of stopping. Death is baffled. \"How?\" he asked, his voice still as cold as the day I met him. \"After eons and eons of heartbreak and loss, war and hatred, how are you still in love with life?\" \"It's simple, really.\" I replied, \"You of all people should know of the circle.\" \"The circle!

This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest. I knew her hatchlings would be too young to fend for themselves. I found them easily. She hadn't moved them since I stumbled upon them the first time, likely too weak from the cancer. They were",

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle.

The faded sun rose through the horizon in the smog filled skies of Rome. I trudged through beggars and merchants on my way to another hard day at the docks. The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The long walk to work provided ample time to daydream about warm meals and deep sleep, luxuries of a distant past. But I didn't have time to daydream today. I couldn't afford to be late. Again.

Most couples have a song, we had a small path that began just inside Gateway Park. My favorite things were the plants. Big, small, leafy, sprightly, nothing really fascinated me so much as watching something grow, watching it slowly make progress, fighting against the sky. I was drawn to the ground, I suppose.

The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze",

        "[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the ultimate theme of The Dark Tower series. Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument. No matter how well-formed her thoughts were, they came out as quips. She wasn't a genius, but she would never stoop to one-liners if she",

        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end. Then stop.\" This simple yet profound advice rings true for every fiction writer. It is the examination of a journey, the exploration of characters, and the weaving of plots that makes a story compelling and engaging. To start, you need to understand your characters, their motivations, and their worlds. Create an environment where they can journey, grow, and eventually find themselves at the end of their story. The beginning is a foundation, a place where you set the stage for the events that will unfold. It has to engage the reader, introduce the key elements, and give a sense of what is to come. The end, however, is not just a cessation. It's a resolution, a place where all the threads of your story come together. So, as a fiction writer, start at the beginning, explore the journey, and bring it all together at the end. Then, as Carroll suggested, you simply stop.",

This was not the usual narrative. This child was not scared but rather, was challenging the darkness.

        "You are a compulsive liar. Convince me you are not. In order to be a good liar-the best liar- you have to be an expert at telling the truth. Sounds paradoxical, right? But hear me out. Lying is an art form that requires the utmost precision. To be a great liar, you have to be a master storyteller, a connoisseur of details. The trick is to craft a narrative so convincing that even you begin to believe it. However, I assure you, I am no such artist. I struggle with the simplest of white lies. But why should you trust me, you ask?\n\nBeing truthful is instinctual for me. It's like my second nature. I struggle to keep track of lies, and I get flustered when I attempt to. I am an open book. My life and my experiences are an open scroll for anyone interested to read. I assure you, I am no liar. I am simply a purveyor of my own truths. My honesty is my cloak, my",
        "Your ascent into sanity began with the thrilling defeat of the pure incarnation of evil. The sensation vibrated through every inch of my being - this thing was finally dead after four agonizing years. The creature, a metaphorical demon, represented everything twisted and wrong in this world, a manifestation of all my fears and insecurities. But now, its reign of terror was over, and I was finally free.\n\nThe battle wasn't easy. It tested my will, my strength, and stretched the limits of my endurance. The daunting journey through the dark valleys of my own psyche was arduous. There were times of unbearable despair and moments when surrender seemed like the only option. Yet, in every crisis, there's an opportunity. This journey taught me resilience, patience, and the true power of perseverance.\n\nEmerging victorious, sanity resumed its place. It was a triumph, not just over the creature, but also over my own inhibitions and fears. The ascent was hard, but it was worth",
        "Within a year of birth every parent receives a small gift or note from their 18yo child via time travel. You don't. 17 years, 11 months, and 29 days later, you are still waiting. Within a year of birth, every parent receives a small gift or note from their 18-year-old child through a ritual that defies time. It's an age-old practice, a symbolic gesture of the circularity of time and life. But not you. You've always been an anomaly. Every day, the mailbox echoes with its emptiness, a void resonating with your heart's anxious silence. Your friends, neighbors, even your own siblings had received their tokens of serene future, but your hands only grappled with the evanescent air. At first, you shrugged it off. But as the years passed, the absence of that note, that gift became a haunting presence. It gnawed at your sanity, fostered a fear that you had never known. Was your child not destined to be 18?",
        "A voice in the sky will tell you when you've left a place for the last time. You tell your significant other goodbye and head out to new adventures, oblivious to the fact that you'll probably never return. The symphony by the universe, chiming in to say farewell, remains unnoticed in the hustle and bustle of life. It's akin to the soft whisper of the wind, the silent goodbye of the sunset, or the quiet hush of the night. It's elusive, a mere echo that resonates deep within the soul. \n\nEvery goodbye is a subtle heralding of change, a shift in the universe\u2019s equilibrium. Leaving, after all, is just the beginning of another journey. It\u2019s a peculiar, almost bittersweet sensation, this sense of finality. It reminds us of the transient nature of moments and places, casting a poignant light on the ever-evolving journey of life. So, the next time you step out, listen carefully. Perhaps the voice in",

This would be a test of how someone can capture the essence of a space without visual aids.\n\nThe room I'm in is a cozy writer's nook, a haven for creativity. Sunlight streams in from a single window, filtered through the emerald leaves of an indoor plant perched on the sill. A heavily laden wooden bookshelf dominates one wall, a rainbow of spines and pages holding stories within stories. My writing desk is a clutter of papers, pens, and half-empty coffee mugs. A vintage typewriter sits on one corner, a silent sentinel of times gone by. A soft armchair with a knitted throw awaits in a corner, acting as a refuge for when the words refuse to flow. Memories hang on the walls in the form of black-and-white photos, each a snapshot of past chapters. The room breathes with an",

        "The day Death died. A young girl sat on a park bench on a brightly colored autumn day. Though her slightly hunched posture subtly indicated she was distressed, her face was obscured by a curtain of chestnut brown hair. The day Death died, a peculiar stillness took hold of the world around her. Birds ceased their songs as if they too could sense the seismic shift in the laws of nature. She sat there, the sole testament to the day mortality itself was extinguished. A gust of wind parted her hair, revealing glistening emerald eyes, not of sorrow, but contemplation. The demise of Death was not a cause for celebration, for with it, life lost its value, its urgency, its vibrancy. The world had become a canvas drained of its colors; the eternality of life had stolen the beauty of the transient. Her eyes spoke volumes of this paradoxical tragedy. The day Death died, the young girl in the park became an ageless witness to the death of life's fullest essence.",

She clutched the worn-out teddy bear closer to her heart, her fingers tracing the faded stitches that held it together. This bear, her cherished companion, had been her best friend since she was a toddler. \n\nFor the little girl, it wasn't just a toy; it was her confidant, friend, and protector during countless sleepless nights. Their bond was created with innumerable whispered secrets and dreams, and fortified with countless cuddles. Now, as she grew older, everyone wanted her to let it go. But how could she? \n\nThe teddy bear, the silent witness to her life's joys and sorrows, was deeply entwined with her memories, woven seamlessly into the fabric of her",

        "A little girl helps her neighbor overcome his vow of silence he made after his wife passed away 40 years ago. I've lived next door to Mr . Peterson for a decade, and in that time, I hadn't heard a single word escape his lips.

The message is scrawled in a hand long gone, yet it speaks to me across the ages.\n\nThe letter, an intimate soliloquy of love, paints a picture of a time when the world was at war, and hearts were scattered across vast oceans.

        "The running faucet The faucet had a third knob. She tried the knob on the left, and hot water came out of the faucet. She tried the knob on the right, and cold water spouted. But when she turned the third knob, something extraordinary happened. The faucet transformed into a portal, an endless cascade of shimmering light. Stunned, she reached into the light, her hand disappearing into the otherworldly glow. She recoiled, then tentatively touched it again, this time leaving her hand in the light. She felt a strange warmth, a sense of belonging that she hadn't felt before. The third knob had unlocked a world beyond her wildest dreams, a world where her imagination could roam free. The faucet's running water had turned into a stream of endless possibilities, a river of dreams and whimsical ideas. From then on, she didn't view the faucet as an ordinary fixture in her home. Instead, it became a wellspring of inspiration, a gateway to her own personal Neverland."
