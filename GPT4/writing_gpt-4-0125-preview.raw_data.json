You've just lived through the second death of the universe and show no sign of stopping. Death is baffled. \"How?\" he asked, his voice still as cold as the day I met him. \"After eons and eons of heartbreak and loss, war and hatred, how are you still in love with life?\" \"It's simple, really.\" I replied, \"You of all people should know of the circle.\" \"The circle!

Their mother had died last week in a territory battle. We don't get those much in the reserve because of the large space and abundant resources, but it still happens. This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest. I knew her hatchlings would be too young to fend for themselves. I found them easily. She hadn't moved them since I stumbled upon them the first time, likely too weak from the cancer. They were",

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle. Breaking the seal on the letter, I unrolled it, reading the letter. *Dear Hanna, If you are reading this, then I have failed. We are cursed, and soon it will pass to you.

The faded sun rose through the horizon in the smog filled skies of Rome. I trudged through beggars and merchants on my way to another hard day at the docks. The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The long walk to work provided ample time to daydream about warm meals and deep sleep, luxuries of a distant past. But I didn't have time to daydream today. I couldn't afford to be late. Again.

Most couples have a song, we had a small path that began just inside Gateway Park. My favorite things were the plants. Big, small, leafy, sprightly, nothing really fascinated me so much as watching something grow, watching it slowly make progress, fighting against the sky. I was drawn to the ground, I suppose.

The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze",

        "[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the ultimate theme of The Dark Tower series. Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument. No matter how well-formed her thoughts were, they came out as quips. She wasn't a genius, but she would never stoop to one-liners if she had a choice.

        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

He always seemed very gentle, very considerate. He never asked for anything, and was happy to listen whenever I spoke to him. A friend of his told me about the vow of silence he took, and about his dedication to the wife he lost so tragically all those years ago. The reason I am standing here today, despite the fact that I am not exactly a close friend or family member, is to say thank you, and pay tribute to a wonderful man. My daughter, Sam, would often talk to him. She would ask him why he doesn't talk, and he would just smile back at her.

But the third nob.... Grace didn't know what that might be. She closed both taps and the faucet stopped running. She would try the third one next. Like everything in Giovanni's workshop, it would probably be something wonderful and unexpected. Birds flew out of drawers when she opened them. The birds were red and green and gold and didn't look like any birds Grace had ever seen, not even when Giovanni had taken her to the aviary at the zoo. The kitchen had these strange machines with gears and pipes that played beautiful music when he tinkered in there. The mirrors were very nice and gave her the most lovely complements when she tried on big-girl clothes. So the mystery of the third faucet tap would also be a great surprise when she tried it.

My eyes were set on the distant horizon, a mix of determination and disbelief swirling within them. Armed with charts and a sturdy boat, I set sail into the infamous triangle, where many had vanished without a trace. The sea was eerily calm, mocking my quest with its tranquil surface. As I ventured deeper, the compass began to spin wildly, defying logic. The air thickened, and a mysterious fog enveloped my boat. Despite the tales, I found myself not in a maelstrom of supernatural forces, but rather in the embrace of a natural wonder. Anomalies in magnetic fields, perhaps, but no portals to other dimensions. My journey debunked myths but confirmed the beauty and mystery of our natural world. The Bermuda Triangle, I discovered, was not a place of doom, but a testament to the unknowns that still captivate",

Each grain represented a moment in time, a speck in the vast desert of the universe, yet together, they told stories that transcended the confines of their fragile medium.

The kingdom of Eldoria, a civilization that thrived on the principles of diplomacy and innovation, found itself at a crossroads.

Readers find themselves on the edge of their seats, eyes wide with anticipation, breaths held tight in their chests. The protagonists, flawed yet endearing, face their darkest moments with a bravery that inspires. Just when the climax seems to reach its peak, when the final battle between good and evil is about to unfold, the stories take an unexpected turn. Instead of epic showdowns or heart-wrenching revelations, the tales conclude with mundane simplicity. The villain decides to retire in the countryside, the long-lost heir to the kingdom opens a small bakery, and the powerful artifact causing all the trouble is accidentally destroyed by a clumsy cat. The anticlimax, though jarring, leaves a lingering sense of bemusement. Perhaps, in the end, the most extraordinary tales are those that embrace the ordinary.",

A mix of relief and melancholy washes over me. This silence means I will return. Yet, the absence of the whisper doesn't ease the weight of the goodbye. Every step away from the love we've nurtured is a step into the vast unknown, a test of faith in the promise of",

This would be a test of how someone could capture the essence of a place with mere words, turning the mundane into something worth illustrating. The room is an amalgamation of chaos and serenity, a study belonging to someone who cherishes both work and leisure. Books, ancient and worn, line the shelves haphazardly, their spines a testament to numerous worlds explored. Amidst this orderly disorder, a hefty, oak desk dominates the center, littered with papers that whisper tales of unfinished stories and forgotten dreams. A single window, framed by heavy, dark curtains, reluctantly allows slivers of light, casting a soft glow over the room. A vintage, leather armchair sits invitingly in one corner, a silent witness to the countless hours spent in contemplation. This room, with its perfect imperfections, is a sanctuary for the creative mind, a haven where",
        "Living in the worst possible timeline\u2014if there is a parallel universe for every possible outcome, there must be one with the worst possible outcomes. Imagine a reality where every decision leads to despair, where natural disasters strike with uncanny precision, and where societal progress is a concept as foreign as peace. In this universe, the air is thick not just with pollution but with the palpable heaviness of collective grief. Technology, rather than advancing civilization, has become its undoing, creating chasms between people wider than can be bridged. Governments operate with Orwellian efficiency, but only in the service of oppression. Yet, even in this bleakest of settings, there exists a flicker of hope. Individuals, though battered by relentless misfortune, discover resilience within. They band together, not in defiance of their reality, but in a quiet assertion of humanity's indomitable spirit. This worst possible timeline, while a harrowing place of existence, becomes a testament to the power of hope against overwhelming",

Though her slightly hunched posture subtly indicated she The day Death died, a young girl sat on a park bench on a brightly colored autumn day. Though her slightly hunched posture subtly indicated she harbored a weight within her, the serene smile playing on her lips told a story of newfound peace. In her hand, she held a peculiar amulet, its ancient engravings shimmering against the backdrop of falling leaves. The world around her seemed to pause, taking in the monumental event that had just occurred. She, a mere mortal, had done the unthinkable \u2013 she'd ventured into the realm of shadows and, with the cleverness of her youth and the purity of her heart, had outwitted Death itself. Now, with Death's powers confined within the amulet, the cycle of life and death was hers to oversee. The consequences of her actions were yet to unfold, but in this moment, she felt an overwhelming sense of victory. Life, for now, was boundless,",
        "Don't leave me, you're my best friend. A little girl sat alone on her bed with her legs tucked tightly to her chest, her tear-streaked face buried in the soft fur of her beloved stuffed rabbit. The room around her felt vast and empty, a stark echo of her heart now that her family had decided it was time to move away. She whispered into the rabbit's ear, promises of never forgetting, of always cherishing the adventures they'd embarked on within the safe confines of her room. Outside, the world awaited with its unknown faces and places, a daunting expanse for a bond as tender as the one she shared with her inanimate confidant. Yet, in the quiet of her room, surrounded by the remnants of a childhood not yet fully left behind, the little girl found a sliver of courage. A courage that softly nudged her to believe that perhaps, in this vast new world, there could be room for new",

It's like the scrolls you use, but imagine if those scrolls could change their text and images at your command, display messages from people far away almost instantly, and even let you hear their voices or see their faces.\" The person from the past narrows their eyes, obviously struggling with the concept. \"This, my friend, is called a smartphone. It's a tool, a very small and powerful one, that fits in the palm of your hand. With it, you can access the sum of human knowledge, communicate across the globe, and even navigate the stars. It's magic, you might say, but it's the kind of magic that is built on the principles of science and technology, advancements far beyond the dreams of scholars and philosophers in your time. It opens doors to new worlds, in a way that those ancient scrolls could never hope to",
        "A little girl helps her neighbor overcome his vow of silence he made after his wife passed away 40 years ago. I've lived next door to Mr. Thompson for as long as I can remember, but I've never heard his voice. The neighborhood children whispered legends about the quiet man with sad eyes. But everything changed when the Anderson family moved in next door. Their youngest, Lily, was a sprite of a girl with boundless curiosity and a heart too big for her chest. Unfazed by Mr. Thompson's silence, she would sit with him on his porch, chattering about her day, sharing stories and drawings. Weeks turned into months, and one crisp autumn afternoon, I was raking leaves when I heard it\u2014a laugh, rusty but warm, floating from Mr. Thompson's direction. Lily had succeeded where time had not; she rekindled the light in Mr. Thompson's eyes, proving that sometimes, all it takes is one persistent heart to reconnect another to",

It's for you. I park my car beside the bridge over the narrow inlet, the ocean's whisper barely audible over the hum of distant traffic. My heart races as I step onto the sand, the sunset painting the sky in hues of fire and gold. The bottle, an antique green glass veiled in years of sea tales, lies half-buried near the water's edge, its presence almost ethereal. With hands trembling, I retrieve it, the cool surface slick against my skin. Inside, a rolled parchment, edges frayed by time, beckons with secrets of the past. As I unfurl the letter, the ink, faded but legible, begins a tale of love lost to the sea, a promise of return, and a name that mirrors mine. The realization washes over me like a wave \u2013 this message, traversing time and tides, was always",

The council's words still echo in my ears, a constant reminder of my banishment to the unforgiving wilderness. Alone, with just the clothes on my back and a small pack of supplies, I step into the unknown. The forest greets me with its cold, indifferent embrace, offering no comfort to my troubled mind. How will I survive? The weight of twenty years looms over me, a sentence that seems more a lifetime than a punishment. Yet, within me burns a flicker of defiance, a determination to endure.

She tried the knob on the left, and hot water came out of the spout, steaming and clear. Turning the right knob released a gush of ice-cold water, refreshing and invigorating. But the third knob, the one that had always been a source of curiosity, remained a puzzle. One day, driven by a mix of bravery and intrigue, Wendy decided to twist the mysterious knob.

It danced in the air, forming shapes and patterns that told stories of distant galaxies and forgotten times. In that moment, Wendy realized the faucet was not just a means to quench thirst but a gateway to uncharted realms, waiting to be explored."
