You've just lived through the second death of the universe and show no sign of stopping. Death is baffled. \"How?\" he asked, his voice still as cold as the day I met him. \"After eons and eons of heartbreak and loss, war and hatred, how are you still in love with life?\" \"It's simple, really.\" I replied, \"You of all people should know of the circle.\" \"The circle!

Their mother had died last week in a territory battle. We don't get those much in the reserve because of the large space and abundant resources, but it still happens. This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest. I knew her hatchlings would be too young to fend for themselves. I found them easily. She hadn't moved them since I stumbled upon them the first time, likely too weak from the cancer.

I toss her over my shoulder and make my way through the house. I watch where I place my feet. A pink bone nearly detonates but I move my foot at the last second. I see the family dog lying on her bed. Or, rather, what's left of it. It's hard to make out this late, but all I can see is shredded blanket. The dog cowers in the back.

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle. Breaking the seal on the letter, I unrolled it, reading the letter. *Dear Hanna, If you are reading this, then I have failed. We are cursed, and soon it will pass to you.

The faded sun rose through the horizon in the smog filled skies of Rome. I trudged through beggars and merchants on my way to another hard day at the docks. The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The long walk to work provided ample time to daydream about warm meals and deep sleep, luxuries of a distant past. But I didn't have time to daydream today. I couldn't afford to be late. Again.

You are free to leave, and my only order is this: I forbid you to shame any soldier who chooses to walk away.

Most couples have a song, we had a small path that began just inside Gateway Park. My favorite things were the plants. Big, small, leafy, sprightly, nothing really fascinated me so much as watching something grow, watching it slowly make progress, fighting against the sky. I was drawn to the ground, I suppose.

The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze",

        "[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the ultimate theme of The Dark Tower series. Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument. No matter how well-formed her thoughts were, they came out as quips. She wasn't a genius, but she would never stoop to one-liners if she had a choice.

A small conversation on the way to class was a victory, a wave and exchange of greetings progress. She became more important to me than I thought possible.

Fewer gestures, more constraint when she was supposed to be care free, joyous and brilliant. Great dark circles formed under her eyes and long sleeves become a frequent part of",
        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

A friend of his told me about the vow of silence he took, and about his dedication to the wife he lost so tragically all those years ago. The reason I am standing here today, despite the fact that I am not exactly a close friend or family member, is to say thank you, and pay tribute to a wonderful man.

The monster, taken aback, hesitated. This was not the scared little boy it had expected to devour with ease. There was something different about him, something almost... supernatural.\n\nAs their eyes locked in the dim light, the monster realized it had not lured in a victim but had",
        "You are a compulsive liar. Convince me you are not. In order to be a good liar\u2014the best liar\u2014you have to master the art of believability, embedding truths within the fabric of your falsehoods. It\u2019s all about the details. When you recount that story of the time you met the mayor at a charity gala, you sprinkle in real facts about the gala's theme and the mayor's public schedule. You remember to fidget with your cufflink, as if nervously adjusting your suit on that imaginary evening.\n\nBut here\u2019s where you falter, and reveal your deception: your eyes dart just slightly to the left, a subconscious betrayal of your fabrication. A true liar, a master, doesn\u2019t have tells. Their confidence is unshakeable, their gaze steady. So, convince me with your steady gaze, and weave your tale with the expertise of a seasoned novelist. Only then might I begin to doubt my conviction that you are, indeed, a compulsive liar",
        "Your ascent into sanity, the thrill of defeating the pure incarnation of evil vibrated through every inch of my body. This thing was finally dead after four grueling years of torment. As the dark clouds began to disperse, a soft, golden sunlight started to filter through, painting the world in hues of hope and renewal. I stood there, panting, my heart pounding in my chest, as I realized the battle was over at last.\n\nThe journey had started in the depths of my own mind, where shadows whispered and conspired. But each step taken was a fight reclaimed from the brink of madness, each victory a stitch in the fabric of my reconstructed sanity. Now, as I looked around at the clearing skies, I understood that the real victory wasn't just over the beast that had haunted me; it was over the darkness within that fed it. I was free, truly free, not just from my nemesis, but from the chains I had forged myself.",
        "Within a year of birth, every parent receives a small gift or note from their 18-year-old child via time travel.

On the eve of your child\u2019s 18th birthday, doubt and worry gnaw at your heart. The world celebrates this phenomenon as a rite of passage, a glimpse into the wonderful lives parents help mold. Yet, your mailbox remains empty, the silence screaming louder than words. Then, the unexpected happens. Not through time travel, but a knock at the door. It's your nearly adult child, eyes brimming with tears and a shy smile. In their hands, a weathered notebook filled with thoughts and dreams meant only for you. \"I wanted it to be a surprise for today,\" they say. Time travel wasn\u2019t their style after all.

        "A voice in the sky will tell you when you've left a place for the last time. You tell your SO goodbye and head out to the quaint, cobbled streets of your soon-to-be old neighborhood. As your feet shuffle through fallen leaves, the familiar chirp of the corner coffee shop's door brings a nostalgic smile. Each step is a muffled echo in the crisp morning air, a tangible reminder of days spent hand in hand, of laughter echoing through the busy squares, of silent promises made under the glistening streetlights. Yet today, the voice is clear, resonant, almost comforting in its certainty. It whispers of change, of new beginnings, and the excitement that comes with them. Though the pang of leaving tinges your heart with sadness, the promise of new adventures fills you with hope. As you turn the corner, the voice assures you, \"This is the last time,\" and somehow, you're ready to step forward into the unknown.",

A grand window to my left bathes the room in a gentle, warm light, casting long shadows from an overstuffed armchair that beckons with its velvety, deep-red cushions. Across the room, a vintage oak desk cluttered with scattered notes, a flickering oil lamp, and an old typewriter sits waiting, as if paused in time.

        "Living in the worst possible timeline\u2014if there is a parallel universe for every possible outcome, there must be one with the worst possible outcomes. Imagine a reality where every decision leads to chaos, every spark of hope is immediately snuffed out, and despair blankets the earth like a suffocating fog. In such a world, resources dwindle rapidly as environmental catastrophes become the norm rather than the exception. Societies crumble under the weight of perpetual conflicts, and advancements in technology only serve to deepen the divide between the powerful and the powerless. Here, humanity is locked in an endless cycle of survival and suffering, where joy is fleeting and hardships are guaranteed. Yet, within this darkest timeline, there are still those who strive for change, holding onto a thread of optimism.

Though her slightly hunched posture subtly indicated she The day Death died, a young girl sat on a park bench on a brightly colored autumn day. Though her slightly hunched posture subtly indicated she was grappling with grief, her eyes, when they lifted, sparkled with a curious blend of melancholy and mischief. Around her, the world seemed oblivious to the monumental shift; leaves fluttered down in gentle spirals, a regular symphony of oranges and reds, and children's laughter echoed across the field. Unbeknownst to them, the girl had stumbled upon a secret so profound that it altered the very fabric of existence: in her hand lay a small, ordinary-looking stone, pulsing with a soft light. Earlier that day, she had watched as a peculiar old woman, her back bent like a bow, had dropped the stone, whispering, \"Death is but a burden we are meant to let go.\" Intrigued and skeptical, the girl had picked it up, and as her fingers brushed",

Her room, a small, sunlit space filled with colorful drawings and scattered toys, felt overwhelmingly empty without the familiar, comforting presence of her older brother. He had left for college that morning, and the house seemed to echo with the silence of his absence.\n\nThe little girl, Emma, stroked the teddy bear's matted fur, remembering how her brother had handed it to her on his own fifth birthday, declaring it her protector from monsters under the bed and stormy nights. Now, she clung to it, hoping it could shield her from the ache of missing him. Every object in her room reminded her of their shared laughter and adventures. As tears welled in her eyes, Emma whispered once more to her bear,",

It's like a magic scroll, but instead of spells, it holds all the knowledge of the world.\" I held up the smartphone, its screen aglow. The man, robed in a simple tunic, squinted skeptically at the device. \"This small tablet allows me to send messages across vast distances, almost instantaneously,\" I continued, trying to bridge centuries of scientific leap in a few sentences. I showed him a video of bustling city life, his eyes widening with every passing image. \"And with this, we can capture moments in time, like painting with light, storing them to see again.\" He reached out tentatively, his fingers brushing against the cool glass, the icons dancing under his touch. \"So,\" he murmured in awe, \"you hold the power of a thousand scrolls and the speed of the fastest horse in",

I've lived next door to Mr. Thompson for as long as I can remember, and not once had I heard his voice. His presence was always marked by a solemn nod or a gentle smile, nothing more. But then little Marcy moved into the neighborhood. With her boundless curiosity and relentless cheer, she became fascinated by Mr. Thompson\u2019s quiet world.\n\nEvery afternoon, she'd skip next door, chattering incessantly, planting flowers, sharing stories of her school day, seemingly undeterred by his silent nods. Over time, her persistence began to wear down his silent barriers. One crisp autumn evening, as they sat watching the sunset, Marcy pointed to the horizon and asked what he thought about the colors.

She tried the knob on the left, and hot water came out of the spout, scalding her fingertips slightly. Curious, she turned the right knob, and cold water splashed into the basin, chilling the air around her hands. But the middle knob, the one that was different, an antique bronze against the shiny silver of the others, intrigued her the most.\n\nShe dried her hands and hesitated for a moment before twisting the middle knob. Instead of water, a soft, green mist began to pour out, filling the air with an earthy scent reminiscent of a dense, untouched forest. The mist swirled around the room, and as it cleared, she noticed something astonishing. The walls of her bathroom had transformed into glass panes revealing a lush landscape that stretched endlessly. She had discovered not just a faucet, but a portal to another world."
