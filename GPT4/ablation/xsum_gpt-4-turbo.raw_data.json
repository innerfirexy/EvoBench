        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger, the court was told. \"There is no doubt that when the Audi smashed",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an expert on China's ethnic",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat.

She said:\"There are some who would say we have no right to remember or to honour them, we have absolutely every right. \"Everyone, it doesn't matter who you are, has the right to remember their dead in a respectful and dignified manner.\" The four IRA men were shot dead after attacking Coalisland police station.

The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London. Its survey also found five northern city-regions combined had almost as many well-qualified individuals (3.6 million) as London (3.7 million) - but the IPPR forecasts demand for skilled workers in the North is set to increase.

The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT.

But the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it would be \"dangerous and reckless\" to get rid of them permanently. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has released three plans to make the savings. It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene.

        "The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of \"buildings as power stations\". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the funding is from the European Union. The technology being developed aims to enable homes, offices, shops and factories to generate, store and use their own solar energy. It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass on buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing solar air collectors or steel \"skins\" which create cavities between the heated metal and the building to harness and store solar heat. They hope to create buildings which will not need a gas supply. One industrial unit in Port Talbot has already been generating all its own heat through solar power for the last three years. Kevin Bygate, chief executive of Specific said the potential was to deliver a \"game changer\"",

Ports have refused to accept Hanjin cargoes without guarantees that port fees will be paid. However, creditors, banks and the South Korean government are all reluctant to put up the cash.

        "They spend an average of \u00a3581 a year on music festivals, often opting for VIP passes or upgraded camping options. Predominantly, these are millennials, a demographic that has proven to be the most enthusiastic about live music events. According to a recent survey conducted by Music Watch Inc., 78% of millennials attended at least one music festival last year, compared to 61% of Gen Xers and 39% of Baby Boomers.\n\nThe trend reflects a broader shift in consumer spending from material goods to experiences. This propensity is partly driven by the desire for social media content, as scenic festival backdrops make for share-worthy posts. Moreover, festivals are increasingly curating experiences beyond music, offering gourmet food, art installations, and wellness activities, which attract a broader audience and encourage higher spending.\n\nThe economic impact of these events is significant, benefiting local economies through tourism, hospitality, and retail sectors.

No collision occurred, but the incident, occurring at an altitude of 4500 feet, prompted immediate action from air traffic control and an investigation by aviation safety authorities. This close encounter is part of a growing number of similar reports involving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and commercial aircraft, raising concerns about air safety in crowded skies.\n\nExperts emphasize the need for stricter regulations and improved drone tracking technologies to prevent potential accidents. Current laws prohibit drones from flying above 400 feet or within proximity of airports without special permission. However, enforcement remains challenging due to the widespread availability and varying capabilities of consumer drones.\n\nAuthorities are urging drone operators to adhere to established guidelines and are considering additional measures, including mandatory registration and education programs for drone users. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the risks drones pose to air traffic when misused or irresponsibly flown.",
        "A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than two weeks off following the birth of a child, highlighting ongoing challenges in achieving work-life balance. The study, conducted by researchers at Boston University, analyzed responses from 1,500 participants and identified several barriers that prevent fathers from taking leave, including financial concerns, workplace culture, and fear of professional repercussions.\n\nThe data revealed that while 85% of new fathers believed taking paternity leave was important for bonding with their child, many felt compelled to return to work earlier than desired. The report calls for companies to reevaluate their parental leave policies and foster an environment supportive of all parents. Advocates argue that more equitable leave options could improve employee satisfaction and retention, and promote gender equality in both the home and the workplace.

The move has sparked a mix of international reactions and domestic protests.\n\nSupporters of the legislation argue that the changing geopolitical landscape, particularly rising tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, necessitates a more flexible and proactive defense stance. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida stated that this is a strategic measure to strengthen alliances, particularly with the United States, and to enhance national security.\n\nHowever, critics are concerned about the potential for entanglement in foreign conflicts and what this could mean for Japan's future. They argue that this move could lead Japan away from its long-standing commitment to peace and could provoke increased militarization in",
        "Aiden Webb, 22, from Norwich, set off to climb the Fansipan mountain alone on 3 June. He called his girlfriend to say he had injured himself but was pressing on despite the pain. Tragically, that was the last time anyone heard from him. A massive search ensued, with local authorities, volunteers, and even other climbers joining the effort to locate the missing hiker. Webb, an experienced climber and aspiring actor, had underestimated the rugged terrain of Fansipan, often referred to as \"the Roof of Indochina\". After several tense days, his body was found in a deep ravine near the trail. The exact circumstances of his fall remain unclear, but his tragic death has sparked conversations about the risks of solo hiking and the importance of preparedness in adventure sports. The climbing community and his family have called for increased safety measures and better tracking systems for solo adventurers to prevent such tragedies in the future.",
        "The site is believed to contain thousands of copies of a video game called ET The Extra-Terrestrial. A company called Atari made the game in 1982, intended to capitalize on the popularity of Steven Spielberg\u2019s blockbuster film. However, the game was rushed to meet holiday season deadlines and ended up being critically panned for its poor gameplay and confusing objectives. As a result, it is often cited as one of the worst video games ever made and blamed for contributing to Atari's financial decline.\n\nIn a bid to cut their losses, Atari allegedly disposed of millions of unsold and returned cartridges by burying them in a landfill in Alamogordo, New Mexico. Interest in the urban legend grew over the years, leading to a 2014 excavation that confirmed the presence of the cartridges.\n\nThis discovery not only settled a long-standing video game myth but also sparked conversations about consumerism, corporate responsibility, and the environmental impact of electronic waste. Today, the unearthed cartridges are considered collectors' items,",
        "Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes and businesses were shut when major flooding hit Stoke Newington, Blackheath, and Islington. Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, called an emergency meeting to address the escalating crisis, as the River Thames's water levels rose unexpectedly, causing widespread disruption. Emergency services worked tirelessly to rescue residents trapped by rising waters and to fortify defenses against further flooding.\n\nLocal authorities established temporary shelters in nearby schools and community centers to accommodate those displaced. The flood also caused significant transport delays, with several major roads submerged and public transport routes disrupted.\n\nMeteorologists linked the severe flooding to unusually heavy rainfall over the past few days, exacerbated by London's already saturated ground. Environmental experts have urged immediate action to improve urban drainage systems and enhance flood barriers, emphasizing that such extreme weather events are likely to become more frequent and severe due to climate change. Meanwhile, recovery efforts are underway, with a focus on assessing structural damages and supporting affected communities.",

        "Disguised as police, they broke through a fence on Monday evening and broke into the cargo of a Swiss-bound plane to take the valuable shipment of diamonds estimated to be worth over $50 million. The audacious heist, which took place at Brussels Airport, was executed with precision and speed, sparking an international investigation. Authorities reported that at least eight individuals dressed in uniforms resembling those of the airport police intercepted the plane as it was being loaded. Armed and without firing a single shot, they managed to access the cargo hold, remove approximately 10 parcels of diamonds, and escape in vehicles bearing a striking resemblance to police cars. No injuries were reported during the incident, but the theft has raised serious concerns about security measures at major transportation hubs. The stolen diamonds were part of a consignment being transported from the Antwerp diamond district, renowned for its significant role in the global diamond trade.",
        "The Lyndhurst Park Hotel, once linked to smuggling, was visited by Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson. Developer PegasusLife wants to replace it with a modern residential complex designed to cater to the needs of the elderly. This proposal, however, has sparked a wave of controversy among locals and historians alike, who fear the loss of a significant historical landmark. The hotel, nestled in the heart of the New Forest, has stood since the early 19th century and is noted for its picturesque architecture and storied past, which includes tales of secret tunnels and hidden treasures.\n\nPegasusLife argues that the new development would provide much-needed housing for the aging population, featuring 75 apartments, communal facilities, and landscaped gardens designed for accessibility. Despite these intentions, the plan faces stiff opposition from community members who are campaigning to preserve the original structure or, at the very least, integrate the historical elements into the new design. As the debate continues, the future of this historic site hangs in the balance"
