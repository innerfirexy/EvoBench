Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is",

The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT.

But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed as well. \"The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles,\" said Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive. \"Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave.\" He said there remained a \"cultural expectation\" within organisations",

A video showing the Smart Cast in action shows how twisting the mounting for the device's lens turns it from a standard wall projector into \"surface mode\" that beams the display on to a table top. A kickstand mounted on the back of the phone keeps the device upright while the virtual keyboard is in use.

        "The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of \"buildings as power stations\". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the funding is from the European Union. The technology being developed aims to enable homes, offices, shops and factories to generate, store and use their own solar energy. It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass on buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing solar air collectors or steel \"skins\" which create cavities between the heated metal and the building to harness and store solar heat. They hope to create buildings which will not need a gas supply. One industrial unit in Port Talbot has already been generating all its own heat through solar power for the last three years. Kevin Bygate, chief executive of Specific said the potential was to deliver a \"game changer\" on energy: not only for buildings",

        "The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two. The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house and is being seen as a significant shift from the post-war pacifist constitution. This move, spearheaded by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, has sparked widespread debates across the nation regarding Japan's future role on the global stage. Supporters argue that the evolving regional security threats, particularly from North Korea and the increasing military assertiveness of China, necessitate a more proactive stance in international defense collaborations. However, opponents fear that such a change could entangle Japan in foreign wars, undermining its pacifist ideals established post-1945. The upper house of the Diet is expected to deliberate on this issue intensely. With both domestic public opinion and international diplomatic relations at stake, the outcome of this legislative change could redefine Japan's military engagements in the coming years.",

        "The site is believed to contain thousands of copies of a video game called ET The Extra-Terrestrial. A company called Atari made the game in 1982, designed to capitalize on the popularity of Steven Spielberg's blockbuster movie. However, the game was rushed to market and famously flopped due to its poor gameplay and numerous bugs. As a result, unsold cartridges were rumored to be buried in a landfill in Alamogordo, New Mexico. \n\nDecades later, this urban legend attracted significant attention, leading to a 2014 excavation documented in the film \"Atari: Game Over.\" The dig confirmed the rumors, uncovering several thousand cartridges and other Atari materials, providing a poignant symbol of the early 80s video game industry crash. This discovery not only vindicated the long-standing myth but also offered a nostalgic glimpse into the era of arcade games, further cementing ET's place in pop culture history as one of the biggest flops in video gaming.",
