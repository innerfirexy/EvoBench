        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger, the court was told. \"There is no doubt that when the Audi smashed",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat. It's simply what the rule says. The rules are the rules",

She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties.

At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. \"In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,\" he said. Mr Carney said the issuance of green bonds - for example, to help finance water or renewable power projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions - could double in 2016 from last year's $42bn.

The research by the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) blamed \"ingrained\" attitudes among employers, and concerns among new fathers that they could not afford to take leave. Last year the government announced plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave - changes are scheduled to come in April 2015. But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed as well. \"The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles,\" said Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive. \"Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave.\" He said there remained a \"cultural expectation\" within organisations that women rather than men will be the ones",

Boss Arsene Wenger described Debuchy's injury on Sunday as \"unbelievable\". \"It's very unfortunate,\" said the Frenchman. \"It's unbelievable because he's had two surgeries in the same season.

The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the funding is from the European Union. The technology being developed aims to enable homes, offices, shops and factories to generate, store and use their own solar energy. It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass on buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing solar air collectors or steel \"skins\" which create cavities between the heated metal and the building to harness and store solar heat. They hope to create buildings which will not need a gas supply. One industrial unit in Port Talbot has already been generating all its own heat through solar power for the last three years.

        "Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales are taking part in a pilot scheme following the study. Coercive or controlling behaviour became a criminal offence last year. The research found that although most domestic abuse incidents were handled in a \"professional\" way, some officers still displayed \"negative and uninformed\" attitudes. In particular, police tended to neglect cases where suspects did not use violence but tried to control their victim in other ways such as by making threats. The report said: \"A tendency for the police to focus on physical violence and what has occurred at the current incident can result in them missing abuse which is characterised not by physical violence and injury but by continuous coercion and control in other forms.\" The researchers concluded that if risk was not assessed properly some cases would \"slip through the net\".

        "Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales were scrutinized in a study revealing a significant shift in prioritizing violent crime, inadvertently sidelining other critical aspects of law enforcement such as cybercrime, theft, and fraud. The report, released Thursday, highlights an operational blind spot where crimes without an immediate physical threat are not receiving the attention they require. This oversight is particularly concerning given the rising trend of online crimes which often go underreported. According to the study's findings, such an approach could result in a substantial number of victims not receiving the support they need and criminals escaping justice. The College of Policing has called for a balanced approach to crime fighting, emphasizing the importance of not only addressing violence but also bolstering efforts against less visible yet equally damaging criminal activities. The report urges police forces to reevaluate their prioritization strategies to ensure a comprehensive crime prevention framework that is responsive to the evolving",
        "The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two. The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house, marking a significant shift in Japan's post-war pacifist stance. The upper house's approval could see Japanese forces taking on more aggressive roles overseas, particularly in peacekeeping missions and in defense of allies. \n\nThis move is part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's broader push to bolster Japan's military capabilities amid rising tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, especially with North Korea's nuclear provocations and China's assertive maritime claims. Critics argue that the changes could entangle Japan in foreign wars, deviating from its pacifist constitution enacted in 1947, which renounces the use of force in settling international disputes.\n\nSupporters, however, see this as a necessary step for Japan to shoulder more responsibility on the global stage, enhancing its ability to protect its citizens and contribute to international peace and stability. The debate continues as the nation grapp",

        "The site is believed to contain thousands of copies of a video game called ET The Extra-Terrestrial. A company called Atari made the game in 1982, which quickly became infamous for its poor reception and is often credited with contributing to the video game industry crash of 1983.
