You've just lived through the second death of the universe and show no sign of stopping. Death is baffled. \"How?\" he asked, his voice still as cold as the day I met him. \"After eons and eons of heartbreak and loss, war and hatred, how are you still in love with life?\" \"It's simple, really.\" I replied, \"You of all people should know of the circle.\" \"The circle!

Their mother had died last week in a territory battle. We don't get those much in the reserve because of the large space and abundant resources, but it still happens. This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest.

Should we all just forget about this and go home? Maybe...... Should we heed the AI's warning? We all looked at each other, each person in the lab more afraid then the next to say a word.

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle. Breaking the seal on the letter, I unrolled it, reading the letter. *Dear Hanna, If you are reading this, then I have failed. We are cursed, and soon it will pass to you.

The faded sun rose through the horizon in the smog filled skies of Rome. I trudged through beggars and merchants on my way to another hard day at the docks. The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The long walk to work provided ample time to daydream about warm meals and deep sleep, luxuries of a distant past. But I didn't have time to daydream today. I couldn't afford to be late. Again. As I neared the docks, my eyes were drawn to a nearby newsstand.

Most couples have a song, we had a small path that began just inside Gateway Park. My favorite things were the plants.

The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze",

Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument. No matter how well-formed her thoughts were, they came out as quips. She wasn't a genius, but she would never",

        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

        "When you die, you don't go to the afterlife of your religion, you go to the afterlife of the religion whose tenets you followed most. This intriguing concept echoes the universality of moral and ethical codes across various religions. It\u2019s not about the label you wear, but the essence of your actions, principles, and the beliefs you embody. You might be a Christian, but if your values align more with Buddhism, you will find yourself in Nirvana. A self-proclaimed Atheist, if they lived by the Hindu principles of Dharma, Karma, and Moksha, will find themselves in the Hindu afterlife. This thought-provoking concept underlines the fact that the afterlife isn't tied to a specific religion but tied to the principles of truth, righteousness, and goodness that you uphold in life. It is indeed a liberating and universal perspective on religious morality and individual faith journey.",

        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing fiction is a voyage, a meandering journey through the labyrinth of imagination. It is an exploration of ideas, emotions, characters, and worlds, stitched together by the delicate thread of words. To start, one must delve into the very roots of the story, the origin of the characters and their motivations. It is akin to planting a seed and nurturing it till it blossoms into a sprawling tree of narratives. The foundation of every compelling story lies in its strong, relatable characters that resonate with the reader. The characters are the lifeblood of the story, driving its progress. They traverse the plot's winding paths, leading the reader through thrilling highs and heart-wrenching lows. Then, when the journey comes to its end, the writer must know when to draw the curtain, leaving the reader with a sense of satisfaction and yearning.

        "Life and Death decide to switch places for a time to see which of their jobs is harder. Death looked across the stars, at the glowing figure of Life, who shimmered with an aura of creation and renewal. They exchanged a solemn nod of mutual understanding. For eons these ancient entities observed the other\u2019s work from afar, each convinced their role was the more challenging. Death, who harvested souls at the end of their earthly journey, and Life, who breathed existence into countless forms.\n\nIn the role of Life, Death found the act of creation exhausting, an endless cycle of birthing and nurturing, a constant surge of energy. It was an unending dance of growth and decay that left him breathless. Life, in the role of Death, experienced the heavy toll of endings, the quiet stillness too severe to bear. They soon recognized, with a newfound respect, the vast love and responsibility each carried in their cosmic duties. Each role, critical to the eternal balance, was equally challenging",

The beast peered through the small opening, its eyes gleaming with anticipation, only to be taken aback. The child, instead of trembling with fear, was beaming with a smile so innocent and pure, it pierced the darkness of the closet, revealing the monster's grotesque form.\n\nFor the first time in its existence, the monster felt a peculiar sensation. It was fear. The child's innocence, her unaffected joy despite the looming menace, had shaken the creature to its core. Its feral instincts screamed danger; the unfamiliarity of innocence and purity was a threat to its monstrous nature. The beast recoiled, and for once, the monster was the one who was afraid. It was not the child who was lured into the darkness, but the darkness that was lured into the light. The",
        "You are a compulsive liar. Convince me you are not. In order to be a good liar-the best liar- you have to be utterly believable. So, let me clarify this: I am not a compulsive liar. \nCompulsive liars have no control over their lying, they lie without thinking or reason, often spiraling into a web of deceit. However, I am not one. I understand the significance of truth, the value of trust, and the importance of maintaining it. I respect relationships, I acknowledge the damage lies can cause, and I consciously choose to avoid that path.\n\nFurthermore, a compulsive liar's stories are usually inconsistent and erratic, while my narrative remains steady and reliable. I don't create alternate realities, I simply live in the real one. Honesty is a virtue I hold dear, and my actions reflect this belief. I am not a master of deception but a pursuer of truth. Hence, I assure you, I am not a compulsive liar. And that's the honest truth.",
        "Your ascent into sanity The thrill of defeating the pure incarnation of evil vibrated through every inch of my body. This thing was finally dead after four agonizing years of torment. Your ascent into sanity, however, was no easy feat, akin to climbing a treacherous mountain peak in blinding snow.

But you battled them with the sword of rationality, the shield of mindfulness, and the armor of therapy. You endured countless sleepless nights, writhing in the icy grip of your past. \n\nYet, it was worth it. For the first time in years, the sun of sanity shone on you, warming you, healing you.

        "A voice in the sky will tell you when you've left a place for the last time. You tell your significant other goodbye and head out to the airport, the familiar scent of your home lingering in your nostrils.

As the plane ascends, the city below gradually shrinks, the enormity of the decision sinking in. It\u2019s a symphony of emotions, the excitement of the new intertwined with the nostalgia of the old.

A quaint writing desk stands opposite the window, cluttered with papers, a typewriter, and a half-empty cup of coffee.

        "Living in the worst possible timeline - if there is a parallel universe for every possible outcome, there must be one with the worst possible outcomes. Every decision, every moment, every chance taken or avoided results in the bleakest circumstances conceivable. This is a universe where luck is a myth, and the concept of hope is as foreign as a warm summer day in the heart of an eternal winter. Here, love and joy are rarely experienced, replaced instead by sorrow and despair. It is a place of perpetual darkness, where happiness is just a fleeting shadow, never quite tangible. A universe where every step forward is met with two steps back. Yet, even in this gloom, life persists. It struggles, it fights, it endures. It finds a way. Because even in the worst possible timeline, the spirit of existence remains unshattered. It is a testament to the resilience of life, an ode to its indomitable will to survive, no matter what.",
        "The day Death died. A young girl sat on a park bench on a brightly colored autumn day. Though her slightly hunched posture subtly indicated she was troubled, the vibrancy of her fiery red hair contrasted with the melancholy in her eyes. Today was the day she learned that Death had died.\n\nThe news was peculiar, disconcerting. How could Death, the inescapable end we all ultimately face, cease to exist? Yet, it had. The concept of mortality had suddenly become obsolete. The world buzzed with confusion and a strange, unsettled joy. Life, it seemed, had triumphed.\n\nBut the girl, lost in thought on the bench, felt a pang of sorrow. Without death, life lost its urgency, its purpose. The beauty of the falling leaves, the ebbing sun, the fleeting moments, all seemed less poignant now. Her heart ached at the thought of an endless monotony of days.\n\nAnd so, on the day Death died, the young girl mourned. For it was on this day that she truly understood the inherent beauty of life's transience.",

Her teary eyes were fixed on a small, worn-out teddy bear, Mr. Snuggles. It was not just a toy, but a symbol of comfort and friendship. It was an old gift from her grandmother, a remnant of her childhood innocence in the face of an increasingly complex world. The bear, having been with her through every high and low, was more than an inanimate object, it was a cherished companion.

A new family moved in just across from Mr. Wilson's home, including a cheerful little girl named Lily. Lily, with her boundless energy and innocent curiosity, was undeterred by Mr. Wilson's silence.
