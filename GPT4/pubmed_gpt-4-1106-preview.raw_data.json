    "Question: Is coeliac disease screening in risk groups justified? Answer: Long-term dietary compliance in screen-detected patients was good. Quality of life and bone mineral density were comparable with those in non-coeliac subjects and the general population. Active screening in coeliac disease risk groups seems to be reasonable rather than harmful.",
    "Question: Does blood pressure change in treated hypertensive patients depending on whether it is measured by a physician or a nurse? Answer: Systolic BP measured by the nurse in treated hypertensive patients is significantly lower than the readings obtained by the physician, and are almost identical to ambulatory BP monitoring. Blood pressure determination by the nurse is desirable not only for diagnosis but also to evaluate the level of control of blood pressure during",
    "Question: Metastatic carcinoma to the cervical nodes from an unknown head and neck primary site: Is there a need for neck dissection?

Answer: With monitoring of MEP and SSEP, sacrifice--without reimplantation--of as many as 15 intercostal and lumbar arteries during TAA/A repair is safe, resulting in acceptably low rates of immediate and delayed paraplegia. This experience suggests that routine surgical implantation of segmental vessels is",
    "Question: Are sports medicine journals relevant and applicable to practitioners and athletes?

The impact of living alone and living with a partner seems to",
    "Question: Major depression and alcohol use disorder in adolescence: Does comorbidity lead to poorer outcomes of depression? Answer: The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be",
    "Question: Stretch-sensitive KCNQ1 mutation A link between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation? Answer: These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF.

    "Question: Diagnostic characteristics of child bipolar I disorder: does the \"Treatment of Early Age Mania (team)\" sample generalize? Answer: Generalization of the RCT sample was supported, because only 7.8% of Phenomenology subjects did not fit the RCT criteria. Nevertheless, because the RCT subjects were more severely ill, it is unclear if treatment findings from the RCT will be applicable to children with less severe mania.",
    "Question: Do provider service networks result in lower expenditures compared with HMOs or primary care case management in Florida's Medicaid program? Answer: The Medicaid Demonstration in Florida appears to result in lower PMPM expenditures. Demonstration PSNs generated slightly greater reductions in expenditures compared to Demonstration HMOs.

    "Question: Ultra high risk (UHR) for psychosis criteria: are there different levels of risk for transition to psychosis? Answer: Our data suggest that UHR intake criteria predict transition over 6 months in the order of Trait alone<APS<BLIPS. The fact that BLIPS patients are at the highest risk of transition over the short term is consistent with the \"early\" versus \"late\" prodrome model. It also indicates",
    "Question: Does angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 (ACE-1) gene polymorphism lead to chronic kidney disease among hypertensive patients? Answer: It is concluded that ACE-DD genotype may be a risk factor for the causation and development of chronic kidney failure among hypertensive patients.",
    "Question: Is there a first night effect on sleep bruxism? Answer: The results showed no overall first night effect on severity of RMMA frequency in young and healthy patients with SB. In clinical practice, one-night sleep recording may be sufficient for moderate-high frequency SB patients. However, low RMMA frequency in the first night could be confirmed by a second night",
    "Question: Does Residency Selection Criteria Predict Performance in Orthopaedic Surgery Residency?
