        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an expert",

        "Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea last week after attempts to bail out the indebted company failed. Ports have refused to accept Hanjin cargoes without guarantees that port fees will be paid. However, creditors, banks and the South Korean government are all reluctant to put up the cash. The global economic downturn, fierce competition and falling prices has hit profits across the cargo shipping industry and Hanjin collapsed with debts of about $5.4bn (\u00c2\u00a34.1bn) last month. There are an estimated 89 Hanjin ships out of its 141-vessel fleet in difficulty, and some have been seized by creditors. The ships contain everything from computer parts to perishable food with many of the cargoes destined for the Christmas market in the US and Europe. Samsung Electronics has said it has goods worth about $38m on Hanjin ships in international waters. It is now considering chartering 16 freighter planes to take goods to customers - mostly in the US.

        "The proposals are believed to include tougher English language requirements for students. Dominic Scott, head of the UK Council for International Student Affairs, said it would have significant implications for those looking to study in the UK. \"Language requirements are already quite stringent,\" he stated. \"Making them even tougher could deter many talented international students from choosing the UK as their study destination.\"\n\nThe government's plans aim to reduce the number of non-EU students who allegedly misuse the student visa system. However, critics argue that the measures could damage the UK's reputation as a welcoming destination for international students, ultimately harming the economy and education sector. International students contribute significantly to the UK's economy, generating billions of pounds in revenue each year. The proposed changes have sparked concerns among universities and student organizations, who fear they could undermine the UK's position in the global education market.",
        "The Financial Conduct Authority said these customers were profitable for card providers and so there were few incentives for the firms to intervene. It said customers should be given more help to avoid falling into persistent debt. The regulator has ordered credit card companies to review their lending practices to ensure that customers are not being led further into debt.\n\nAccording to the FCA, over 3 million credit card holders are considered to be in persistent debt, meaning that they are paying more in interest and charges than the actual amount borrowed. The regulator has expressed concerns that credit card companies are not doing enough to help these customers.\n\nAs a result, credit card providers have been ordered to take steps to identify and assist customers who are struggling with debt. This may include suspending interest payments or even cancelling debt in extreme cases.",

Dr Tim Green wrote Mr Butler found it \"difficult to control his temper\" and struggled with \"impulsive behaviour\" in a report following a series of sessions with him.\n\nAlmost two decades on, Mr Butler's inability to manage his anger has had devastating consequences. Last week, he was jailed for life with a minimum term of 23 years after being found guilty of murdering his six-year-old daughter, Ellie.\n\nDuring the trial, the court heard how Mr Butler had subjected Ellie to a violent outburst, resulting in her death. His history of violent behaviour was also laid bare, including a previous conviction for assaulting his ex-partner.\n\nThe case has raised questions about how a man with a known history of violent behaviour was able to carry out such a heinous crime, and what support systems were in place to prevent such tragedies from occurring.",

Located in Wales, the Nanteos Mansion has a rich history that dates back to the 17th century, and the cup itself has long been a subject of fascination. For many years, it was believed to be the Holy Grail, the cup said to have been used by Jesus at the Last Supper.

        "Charles Mumbere, the king of Rwenzururu, is entitled to these privileges because he suffers from hypertension and diabetes, it added. This was according to a high court ruling that has granted the jailed king special treatment while in prison. Mumbere, who was arrested and jailed in 2016 on charges of murder, terrorism, and treason, will now receive special privileges due to his ill health.\n\nThe court ruled that the king's health conditions required him to have access to his personal doctor and be provided with a special diet to manage his conditions. Additionally, Mumbere will be allowed to have visitors outside of regular visitation hours, as long as they are cleared by the prison authorities. The ruling has been met with both relief and criticism, as some see it as preferential treatment for the monarch.

The lioness is seen nursing a leopard cub, a sight that has left experts stunned.\n\nAccording to the team, the lioness had recently given birth to her own cubs, but seemed to have adopted the leopard cub as one of her own. This unusual behavior is known as \"cross-species nursing\" and is rarely seen in the wild.\n\nThe conservationists believe that the leopard cub's mother may have been killed or separated from her cub, leading the lioness to take on a maternal role. While the chances of the leopard cub's survival are uncertain, the images provide a heartwarming glimpse into the complexities of animal behavior and social bonding in the wild.",
