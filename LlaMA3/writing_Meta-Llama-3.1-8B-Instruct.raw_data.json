Their mother had died last week in a territory battle. We don't get those much in the reserve because of the large space and abundant resources, but it still happens. This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest. I knew her hatchlings would be too young to fend for themselves. I found them easily. She hadn't moved them since I stumbled upon them the first time, likely too weak from the cancer.

The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake.

The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze",

        "A Creation Myth / Myth in General.\n\nIn the depths of our collective imagination lies an endless array of mysteries waiting to be unraveled. A creation myth, often shared across cultures, sets the stage for our understanding of the world's origins. These myths aim to provide explanations for natural phenomena, the emergence of life, and the complexities of the human experience.\n\nTake the Greek myth of Niobe, for instance, where the goddess Artemis punished the queen for her boasts by turning her and her children into stone. This myth serves as a cautionary tale, illustrating the consequences of unchecked ego and the power of the divine. Similarly, the creation myth of the Maori people in New Zealand explains the origin of the world and the first humans, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all living beings. These myths not only reveal the creative potential of the human mind but also offer valuable insights into the universal human condition.",

Can we create similar technology on Earth, or will Echo-1 remain a cosmic enigma?",
