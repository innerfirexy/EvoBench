        "This paper studies the energy landscape of the loss function in neural networks.  It is generally clearly written and nicely provides intuitions for the results.  However, the results are not as robust as one might expect given the complexity of the problem.  The paper could benefit from more explicit explanations of the assumptions made, more rigorous",
        "This paper provides a simple method to handle action repetitions. They make the action a tuple (a,x), where a is the action chosen, and x is the number of repetitions. For example, (A, 2) means the action A is chosen twice. The paper then presents a simple formula to compute the expected value of the action, which is",
        "This paper proposed a proximal (quasi-) Newton\u2019s method to learn binary DNN. The main contribution is to combine pre-conditioning with the proximal Newton\u2019s method. In addition, we also propose a new method to handle the non-convexity of the objective function in binary DNN. The proposed method is based on the idea of",
        "This paper is a parallel work to Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching. The main solution of both papers is a denoising feature matching technique, which can be used to improve the quality of the generated images in the generative adversarial networks (GANs). The denoising feature matching technique is based"
