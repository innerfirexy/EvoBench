This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers.

Light cracked open from the void, and stars fell from Creations palms. Destruction shattered the light with darkness; for every star a hole of blackness took the light. For three eternities their drama unfolded. They littered the darkness with the refuse of battle. As Destruction struck a mighty blow, a single drop of blood fell from the brow of Creation. It splattered against a drifting bone from the rib of Destruction. The blood and bone warped and twisted as it hurtled through the dark. As the pieces of Darkness and Light fused together, the world was born. The world of Creation and Destruction was born from battle. The battle continued on the small sphere and from it came life.",

        "When you die, you don't go to the afterlife of your religion, you go to the afterlife of the religion whose tenets you followed most. This concept challenges traditional notions of an afterlife, where one's faith is believed to dictate their destination. Instead, it suggests that actions and deeds are the true measure of a person's spiritual alignment. For instance, a Christian who practices Buddhist mindfulness and compassion may find themselves in a realm akin to Nirvana, rather than Heaven. Similarly, a Muslim who embodies the principles of Hinduism, such as karma and dharma, may be reborn into a Hindu-inspired afterlife. This idea emphasizes the importance of living a life of virtue and integrity, regardless of one's professed faith. By doing so, individuals can ensure a peaceful and fulfilling transition into the afterlife, one that reflects their true spiritual nature.

The beast peered through the small crack of the closet door, its glowing eyes fixed on the little one. As the child stepped inside, the monster pounced, wrapping its claws around the tiny frame. But instead of the expected scream, the child began to giggle. The monster's grip loosened, confused, as the child started to chat excitedly about the \"cool shadows\" and \"fun hiding spot\". The beast's confusion turned to alarm as it realized the child wasn't afraid - in fact, they seemed to be enjoying themselves.

        "[ CW ] Describe the room you're sitting in, maybe r/doodle will sketch it. This would be a test of how someone interprets your description. The room I'm sitting in is a cozy little space with cream-colored walls and a large window that lets in plenty of natural light. There's a comfortable armchair in one corner, with a side table next to it holding a steaming cup of coffee. A desk sits against one wall, cluttered with papers, pens, and a laptop. The floor is made of dark hardwood and is covered with a plush area rug in a deep blue color. A bookshelf stands against another wall, filled with volumes of all shapes and sizes. The atmosphere is quiet and peaceful, making it the perfect spot to sit and write. I wonder how accurately r/doodle will be able to bring this space to life.",
        "Living in the worst possible timeline / If there is a parallel universe for every possible outcome, there must be one with the worst possible outcomes. This concept, derived from the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, suggests that every time a decision or event occurs, the universe splits into multiple parallel universes, each with a different outcome. It's a daunting thought to consider that we might be living in the universe where everything has gone wrong. Every mistake, every poor decision, and every catastrophe has occurred, leading to a reality that is ravaged by conflict, environmental disaster, and societal collapse. The possibility that there are infinite universes with better outcomes, where humanity has made more prudent choices, only serves to highlight the bleakness of our own reality. It's a chilling prospect, leaving us to wonder if we're truly living in the worst of all possible worlds.",

A sense of freedom and possibility washed over her, and she smiled, knowing that the world would never be the same again.",
