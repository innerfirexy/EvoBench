        "This paper builds on the work of Weston (2016), using End-to-end memory network models for a limited form of dialogue with teacher feedback. We propose an extension of the end-to-end memory network model to accommodate the teacher feedback. We introduce a new architecture that combines the strengths of the end-to-end memory network model and the teacher feedback mechanism. Our proposed",
        "This paper extends the GAN framework to allow for latent variables. The observed data set is expanded by drawing latent variables z from a conditional distribution q(z|x) that is parameterized by a neural network. This conditional distribution is learned jointly with the generator network, along with the discriminator network. The generator network learns to map a latent variable",
        "This paper introduces a simulator and a set of synthetic tasks for evaluating a dialogue agent's ability to learn from user feedback. For solving these tasks, we propose a novel dialogue management model called Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). HRL uses a two-level hierarchical structure to learn the optimal dialogue strategy. The lower level",
        "This paper proposes a design principle for computation blocks in convolutional networks based on repeated application of expand and join operations resulting in a fractal-like structure. This principle is called the Fractal Neural Network (FNN). The FNN is an extension of the Inception architecture and can be viewed as a generalization",
        "This paper studies the energy landscape of the loss function in neural networks.  It is generally clearly written and nicely provides intuitions for the results.  However, there are some points that need improvement.\n\n1.  **The motivation of the paper**: The authors argue that the energy landscape of the loss function is a crucial aspect of understanding neural",
        "This paper provides a simple method to handle action repetitions. They make the action a tuple (a,x), where a is the action chosen, and x is the number of times it has been repeated. The reward is updated based on the number of repetitions. This way, the agent learns to exploit the actions that lead to high rewards",
        "This paper proposed a proximal (quasi-) Newton\u2019s method to learn binary DNN. The main contribution is to combine pre-conditioning with quasi-Newton\u2019s method to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. The quasi-Newton\u2019s method is used to approximate the Hessian matrix, and the pre-conditioning is used to improve the convergence rate of the algorithm.",
        "This paper is a parallel work to Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching. The main solution of both papers is the same, which is to use the Denoising Feature Matching (DFM) loss in the GAN training process. However, the approach of the two papers is different.
