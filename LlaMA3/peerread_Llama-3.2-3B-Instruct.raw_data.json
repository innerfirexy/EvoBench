        "This paper extends the GAN framework to allow for latent variables. The observed data set is expanded by drawing latent variables z from a conditional distribution q(z|x) and then using the GAN framework to generate new samples. The key insight is that the latent variables are not necessarily independent of each other, but can be correlated. This allows",
        "This paper introduces a simulator and a set of synthetic tasks for evaluating a dialogue agent's ability to learn from user feedback. For solving these tasks, the simulator models the conversation flow and the user's feedback on the agent's responses. The simulator allows the agent to learn from the feedback by adjusting its",
        "This paper proposes a design principle for computation blocks in convolutional networks based on repeated application of expand and join operations resulting in a fractal-like structure. The proposed design aims to reduce the number of parameters and computations required for convolutional layers while maintaining the ability to capture long-range dependencies in",
        "This paper studies the energy landscape of the loss function in neural networks.  It is generally clearly written and nicely provides intuitions for the results.  The authors use the loss function as a \"game\" to study the energy landscape.  The loss function is a quadratic function, which is a good choice to study the energy landscape",
        "This paper provides a simple method to handle action repetitions. They make the action a tuple (a,x), where a is the action chosen, and x is the object being acted upon. This is the core of the planning algorithm used in the first part of the problem. The planning algorithm uses a breadth-first search to find the shortest",
        "This paper proposed a proximal (quasi-) Newton\u2019s method to learn binary DNN. The main contribution is to combine pre-conditioning with the Newton\u2019s method to speed up the convergence of the optimization algorithm. The pre-conditioning is a technique to improve the convergence of the Newton\u2019s method. The main idea is to use the",
        "This paper is a parallel work to Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching. The main solution of both papers is to introduce a new loss function, the Denoising Feature Matching (DFM) loss, which encourages the generator to produce realistic images by matching the features of the input image with the"
