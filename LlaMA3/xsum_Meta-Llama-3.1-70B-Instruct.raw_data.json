Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which",

China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe",

It said O negative blood made up 12% of transfers, although only 7% of people in the UK had that blood type. Meanwhile, B negative blood is needed for ethnic groups. The NHSBT said ethnic minority groups, who were more likely to have B negative blood, were more prone to sickle cell anaemia, where misshapen blood cells could block blood vessels, causing an early death. It also said such groups were more at risk of developing thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders that hindered the blood's ability to carry oxygen. Only 2% of Britain's population were B negative, but hospitals had used 6% more of this blood type in the past last four weeks than the same period last year,",

However, an extra \u00c2\u00a332m for the DEL, revealed in this week's overall budget improves the situation somewhat. The college says the addition of extra money means it would be asked to manage on a budget reduced by 26.5%. That's a slightly better prediction but the principal, Prof Peter Finn, says that is still far too challenging.

The report is being launched by the organisation to highlight the noticeable disparity in educational outcomes between the regions. According to the findings, students from disadvantaged backgrounds in London tend to achieve higher grades in their GCSEs compared to their counterparts in the northern regions of England.\n\nResearchers attribute this phenomenon to various factors, including better funding, more experienced teachers, and the presence of elite universities in the London area. The report suggests that this disparity can have long-lasting effects on the children's future prospects, limiting social mobility and exacerbating regional inequalities.\n\nThe IPPR is calling on the government to address these disparities by implementing policies aimed at improving education in the north, such as increasing funding and attracting more experienced teachers to the region.

        "The Swiss bank said US regulators were investigating potential sales of so called \"bearer bonds\". These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy individuals to maintain anonymity. The investigation is part of a broader crackdown on tax evasion and money laundering. The bank has acknowledged that it is cooperating fully with the US authorities, providing information and documents as requested. Bearer bonds have long been a concern for regulators, as they can be used to conceal illicit activities and hide assets. The US government has been increasing pressure on foreign banks to disclose information about American clients, and this investigation is seen as a significant step in that effort. The bank's shares fell slightly on the news, as investors weighed the potential implications of the investigation. The outcome is still uncertain, but one thing is clear: the era of secrecy in international banking is coming to an end.",

        "Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, and a revised knowledge test for all private hire drivers, including those working for companies such as Uber. The proposed changes aim to enhance passenger safety and improve driver standards. Under the new rules, drivers would be required to demonstrate a stronger understanding of London's geography and a higher level of English language proficiency. The map-reading test would evaluate a driver's ability to navigate London's complex road network, while the English language test would assess their communication skills. TfL believes these changes will help to reduce the risk of accidents and improve the overall quality of private hire services in the city. The consultation period is expected to last several weeks, during which time the public and industry stakeholders can provide feedback on the proposed reforms.",

        "Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales were analyzed, revealing a concerning trend in how domestic abuse cases are handled. The study found that officers often prioritize physical violence over other forms of abuse, such as emotional or financial manipulation. This narrow focus can lead to a lack of understanding of the complexities of domestic abuse, potentially putting victims at greater risk. The College of Policing has emphasized the need for a more comprehensive approach to addressing domestic abuse, one that takes into account the full range of abusive behaviors. By broadening their perspective, officers can better identify and support victims, ultimately providing more effective protection and intervention. This shift in approach is crucial for improving outcomes in domestic abuse cases. Further training is recommended.",

Developer PegasusLife wants to replace it with a new retirement community, sparking controversy among locals. The hotel, which has been closed since 2014, has a rich history dating back to the 18th century. Stevenson is said to have drawn inspiration from the hotel's surroundings during his stay.
