        "This paper discussses applying an information bottleneck to deep networks using a variational lower bound and reparameterization trick. The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The proposed method is novel and has a clear motivation. The experimental results",
        "This paper proposes the neural noisy channel model, P(x|y), where (x, y) is a input-to-out sequence pair, \u00a0to improve the performance of neural machine translation (NMT) systems. The noisy channel model is a probabilistic model that consists of two components: the language model P(y) and the channel model P(x|y). In NMT, the language model is",
        "This paper builds on the work of Weston (2016), using End-to-end memory network models for a limited form of dialogue with teacher feedback. Weston (2016) established that such models are capable of achieving good results in conversational settings. Here, we demonstrate the application of the same model to a more complex conversational scenario, and show that the model is capable",
        "This paper extends the GAN framework to allow for latent variables. The observed data set is expanded by drawing latent variables z from a conditional distribution q(z|x). The generator is modified to take both the latent variable and the noise variable as inputs. The discriminator is modified to take only the data as input. The inference network is",
        "This paper introduces a simulator and a set of synthetic tasks for evaluating a dialogue agent's ability to learn from user feedback. For solving these tasks, the agent needs to learn to understand the user's goals and preferences from their feedback, and use this understanding to generate responses that are relevant and engaging.",
        "This paper proposes a design principle for computation blocks in convolutional networks based on repeated application of expand and join operations resulting in a fractal-like structure. The proposed design principle is used to construct a convolutional network called fractalnet which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. The fractalnet is compared",
        "This paper studies the energy landscape of the loss function in neural networks.  It is generally clearly written and nicely provides intuitions for the results. The paper proposes a new perspective on the loss landscape, showing that the loss landscape of neural networks is not as chaotic as previously thought. Instead, it has a more structured geometry with",
        "This paper provides a simple method to handle action repetitions. They make the action a tuple (a,x), where a is the action chosen, and x is the number of times the action is repeated. They also introduce the concept of \"repetition penalty\" to discourage the agent from choosing the same action repeatedly. The repetition penalty is defined as",
        "This paper proposed a proximal (quasi-) Newton\u2019s method to learn binary DNN. The main contribution is to combine pre-conditioning with a proximal Newton\u2019s method to handle the non-convex and non-differentiable objective. The algorithm is derived from the proximal quasi-Newton\u2019s method, which is a general framework to solve non-convex and non-differentiable problems. The",
        "This paper is a parallel work to Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching. The main solution of both papers is to modify the loss function of the generator. The difference is that this paper is using a different approach. In this paper, the loss function of the generator is modified"
